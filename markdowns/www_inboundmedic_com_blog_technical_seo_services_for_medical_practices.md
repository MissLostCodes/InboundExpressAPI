![technical seo services for medical practices](https://www.inboundmedic.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/technical-seo-services-for-medical-practices.jpg)

Are you seeking **technical SEO services for medical practices**? When you look at the basics of SEO (search engine optimization) it probably seems really simple. It is common to think that you just sprinkle some keywords in your content and you are good to go.

However, Google is not making it easy to get the best rankings. The algorithm is complex and it can be difficult to get the proper optimization for success. With the complex algorithms comes a somewhat newer type of SEO that you have to consider and this is referred to as technical SEO.

When it comes to technical SEO you are not looking at the content only on your practice’s website. Instead, you have to look at your server and website and determine their optimization. When they are properly optimized, this will improve both the indexing and crawling practices. It will also ensure better visibility of your practice’s website.

There are multiple elements associated with technical SEO services for medical practices, including:

-SSL application

-Removing broken links and pages or 404s

-Finding and disavowing toxic backlinks

-Creating and submitting an XML sitemap

-Site load time optimization

-Getting rid of duplicate content and issues with mixed content

-Optimizing image file size

Other parts of your website might also need to be examined depending on its overall health as it relates to technical SEO.

Due to how popular technical SEO has become and its overall complexity, it is unfamiliar to the majority of medical practice owners. In fact, most practices do not even know that they could use some help for their website.

If you are unsure if your practice website could benefit from a technical SEO professional, ask yourself the following questions:

-Do you want more patients to book an appointment or utilize your services?

-Do you want more current and potential patients to be able to find your website?

-Do you want to reduce your current advertising and marketing costs?

If you said “yes” to any of these, or all of them, then it is time that you took a long, hard look at what technical SEO is and how it can help your medical practice website.

It is also important to know that this type of SEO is not just a one-time effort. You have to be dedicated to it and work with it frequently to get the best results. The health of your digital presence and website require a continual investment so that they can pay off for you now and over the long-term.

You are surely asking yourself what professional technical SEO services are going to cost your practice. Also, you surely want to know if they are what your website actually needs to grow and thrive.

This article will focus on what technical SEO is and the different types that are available. You will learn the average costs of each of the different types here too. Here you will get important information about the tools that you can use to determine how healthy your medical practice website is, allowing you to decide the best types of technical SEO to get it to the next level.

Exploring the Different Types of Technical SEO Services for Medical Practices

Now that you have decided to dive into the world of technical SEO to boost your medical practice website, you have some additional important questions to ask. Of course, your budget is going to be one of the biggest factors in the types of services that you utilize. We have taken the time to discuss the different technical SEO solutions that are available and their possible associated costs to make this easier for you.

### Technical SEO Services For Medical Practices

Compared to a traditional on-page SEO audit, a technical SEO audit of your website is completely different. It will look at all of the features in which your website is able to operate, and it starts at the DNS level. This type of audit will look at your website’s technical aspects to ensure that all of them are functioning as they are supposed to.

A proper technical SEO audit will include off-site factors and schema. When it comes to the schema, you can provide search engines with more information about your site without having to actually put this information on your site’s page for users to see. Essentially, this will tell search engines what your website is about so that they can better understand it.

When this type of audit is performed correctly, it takes about two weeks. However, there are cases when a month is needed to perform a thorough audit. The overall size of your website is a big factor concerning how long a proper audit will take.

You should get a technical SEO audit before you do anything else. It will tell you how healthy the site is so that you can determine the areas that need improvement. Overall, it will save you time and money because it provides the information needed to know which areas of your site that you need to focus on. It will also tell you which other technical SEO services your site could benefit from.

You can expect to pay around $5,000 for a thorough technical SEO audit for your medical practice website. However, the overall complexity and depth of the audit will determine the final cost. The estimated cost range for this service is **$3,000 to $30,000**. A medical practice is likely to be on the lower end of the spectrum since they usually do not have hundreds of URLs or a need for strategies or canonical issues.

### Consulting Services for Technical Medical SEO

Since technical SEO is now considered to be a core business operations element, consulting services for it have become very common. This service is essential for making sure that the website for your medical practice can be easily found on search engines.

Your website has to be able to keep up and adapt with the constantly changing algorithms that Google uses to rank websites in their search results.

Under normal circumstances, you can expect any associated meetings with your consultant to last about an hour and take place once a week. You will discuss the most important elements of the plan and what services are paramount to implement now.

The overall costs of technical SEO consulting vary widely, but you can expect to pay about $1,000 a month for a medical practice website.

### Implementation

Once the technical SEO audit is complete, it is time to make sure that any issues are addressed in a timely manner. This could include a variety of problems, such as reducing the load time for your website, applying an SSL certificate correctly and removing mixed content issues.

A technical SEO strategy should be established following the audit. This should include a timeline so that you know what will be fixed and when.

This is usually an hourly service that averages about $100 per hour for a medical website. However, some agencies may cost as much as $175 per hour. Some agencies will hire outside experts to make the fixes and some will do it all without outside help.

### Retainer for Ongoing Maintenance

Remember that technical SEO is something that is continuous, so you need to make sure that your practice’s website maintains its health.

When you take advantage of ongoing maintenance, a technical SEO professional will ensure overall website upkeep, build your schema, provide development updates and tasks and anything else that is needed related to technical SEO.

Your overall needs will determine the overall cost of the retainer. However, you can expect an average of $1,000 per month for this type of service.

### Exploring Different Technical SEO Tools

You want to know the best strategy and how to tackle all of your website’s technical elements. The best way to ensure that you have the right knowledge is to also learn about the tools that are available to make this possible.

The right tools can keep your website healthy and ensure that you can make the best choices regarding how to enhance your digital presence.

There are various tools on the market that will crawl your website automatically so that you can see what is happening with it behind the scenes. You can also learn about configuration changes and how these can impact organic or Google searches so that you do not make the wrong changes.

Ideally, you want to take a look at your site’s technical SEO health about once a month once you have fixed all of the issues that were revealed in the audit. You can also use this as a way to see what regular improvements can be made to ensure that your site is easy to find on search results.

It is important to note that these tools are important and very helpful. However, they cannot replace the work of a dedicated technical SEO professional. It is common to use the services of both to ensure that your medical website is as healthy as it can be.

The best tools for you will depend on what you are hoping to accomplish and what you need to keep your website healthy. Below is a list of the tools that may benefit you depending on your needs.

#### Screaming Frog

This tool will crawl the URL for your site and give you a list of on-page and technical elements to explore. If you only need to crawl 500 pages or less, there is a free version that you can use. If you have more pages or want to use the version with more advanced features, you can expect to pay $146 to $183 per year.

#### SEMrush

This tool is ideal for SEO, content, competitive, PPC and social media research. You can try it out for free to see what some of the basic features are like. If you want the full version, it ranges from $99.95 to $399.95 per month, depending on how much you want to get out of the tool.

#### Ahrefs

This tool makes it possible to explore competitors, audit your site and research backlinks and keywords. For a basic medical website, you can expect to pay about $99 per month. However, for more complex websites, the cost can go as high as $999 per month.

You can also choose to use [add-ons with this tool](https://ahrefs.com/writing-tools/meta-description-generator). However, each of them has an additional cost.

#### Google Analytics

This is a tool that you have probably heard of before. You will get details regarding the visitors to your website. This helps you to create a better SEO strategy. There is no cost for using Google Analytics.

#### Google Search Console

This is another tool that is free for anyone to use. It allows you to optimize your site’s visibility and check on its indexing status.

#### Google My Business

This tool helps you see what other people see when they search the name of your medical practice. Use this information to ensure that current and future patients are able to find your website. This is a tool that is free to use.

#### Moz Local

This is a type of automated listing management tool. It allows you to sync your location data continuously. Ultimately, when used properly, you will get better visibility in search engine results without having to do a lot of manual work with your website.

With a medical practice website, the basic package is likely sufficient and costs $129 per year. However, if you have other practice locations, you might opt for the plus package at $199 per year or the complete package at $299 per year.

#### BrightLocal

This tool works similar to Moz Local. It is a type of integrated local and SEO citation platform. When used properly, it can help to increase online visibility, develop your online reputation, boost local rankings and build citations.

There are four subscription options with this tool, including the single business option which is ideal for most individual medical practices. It will cost you $29 per month. However, if you have a very large practice or multiple locations, you might choose a more enhanced plan and these include:

-Multi business for $49 per month

-SEO pro for $79 per month

-Enterprise requires custom pricing and you have to contact them for more information

### Technical SEO Freelancer vs. Technical SEO Agency

These are two viable options depending on what your practice needs. Looking at the pros and cons of each can help you to make the best choice.

#### The pros of an agency include:

-Their processes tend to be more standardized

-They likely have a broader range of services

-Their standard services are available in a portfolio for you to explore

#### The cons of an agency include:

-Your experience may be less personalized since you get less one-on-one interaction in most cases

#### The pros of an independent consultant include:

-The level of personalization tends to be a lot higher

-Your interactions are likely to be more tailored to your needs

#### The cons of a freelancer include:

-The pricing may be individualized and, therefore, higher than that of an agency

-Some of the work might be outsourced to other professionals

-They may not have the same level of specialized knowledge that an entire agency has

### Comparing the Prices

Now that you have some more information about agencies and freelancers, it is time to look at the potential costs. Remember that the most critical element is what they can do for your website.

You are hiring a [technical SEO professional](https://www.inboundmedic.com/medical-marketing-services/) to get results, so which one is the best choice for you? This will depend on your needs. Make sure to look at their track record to ensure that they can get the results that you need.

Ultimately, the pricing varies widely. It is best to meet with different agencies and freelancers during your search. Discuss what you need and learn more about their capabilities. From here, compare that along with their pricing to make the best decision.

### Why Investing in Technical SEO is Important Now and in the Future

Websites and internet presence are not going away. Because of this, you need to ensure that both of yours are on point for your medical practice to be at its best. Technical SEO is the way to ensure the highest potential for success.

Google algorithms are always changing, and the right professional can ensure that your site is up to Google’s standards so that you maintain a solid search engine ranking. This is critical, especially if you have a lot of local competition in your area. Also, the medical industry is among the most competitive on Google.

Start looking at technical SEO services and talking to agencies and freelancers. Remember that audits can take two to four weeks to be properly conducted so the time to start is now.
