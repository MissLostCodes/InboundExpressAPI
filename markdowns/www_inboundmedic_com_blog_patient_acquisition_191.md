## What Is Patient Acquisition?

We define **patient acquisition** as bringing new patients into a healthcare practice predictably and scalably. At its core, the focus is on developing tactics that increase your practice’s visibility to convert qualified patient appointments. Implementing our strategies will help your practice stand out to potential patients. This can take many forms, from creating a high-converting website to developing advertising campaigns on social media platforms and producing high-quality SEO-optimized content to educate, inform and answer the questions of your ideal patients. For example, most private practices run targeted campaigns focusing on positive patient testimonials that build trust and establish credibility. This trust is of the utmost importance in healthcare, where patients frequently make decisions based on the experiences of others. By taking on new patients consistently, practices shore up immediate revenue and build a base of long-term viability.

### 1\. Define Patient Acquisition

**Patient acquisition** is more than just getting new patients on the calendar (because not all patients on your calendar will convert to the ideal high-paying patients that will stay with you for the long term). It’s about visibility, trust, and the sustainability of your monthly income through qualified lead acquisition and conversion. Innovative **patient acquisition tactics** build a practice’s trust, brand and online reputation. These include designing visually appealing, data-driven modern websites, search engine optimization, paid search advertising, and compelling social media content. For example, optimizing your website for local search ensures that when someone searches for “family doctors near me,” your practice appears among the top results. As such, building trust is just as important. Healthcare services are not immune to this, as potential patients search for trust metrics and validation before choosing a provider. Showcasing actual patient experiences, before and after shots, and five-star testimonials on your website and social media pages is key. These elements add authenticity to your practice and make it more human. Because when you get patient acquisition right, you have a direct line to revenue. Monitoring the CAC (customer acquisition cost) to LTV (lifetime value) ratio is crucial. More importantly, it tells you if you’re being cost-effective with your efforts.

### 2\. Explain The Role Of Patient Acquisition In Healthcare

**Patient acquisition** is mission-critical in today’s healthcare marketing landscape. It operates with **patient retention** to achieve the ideal equilibrium between the predictability and scalability of your monthly income. While acquisition focuses on attracting new patients, retention emphasizes keeping existing ones engaged, satisfied, and returning for future visits. [**Patient retention**](https://www.inboundmedic.com/blog/patient-retention-strategies/) is often overlooked, yet it plays a vital role in the **overall patient experience**. When you successfully keep your patients happy, they are more likely to stay with your practice and refer friends and family, significantly enhancing patient growth and contributing to a **successful practice**. Acquisition and retention strategies must work cohesively. A well-informed [patient acquisition marketing plan](https://www.inboundmedic.com/patient-acquisition-through-healthcare-web-design-services) can help increase patient volume, while retention strategies, such as automated follow-up emails and loyalty programs, create a personal connection that encourages repeat visits. Together, these [**healthcare marketing strategies**](https://www.inboundmedic.com/blog/medical-practice-marketing/) build a loyal and sustainable patient base. Notably, data reveals that almost 50% of booked patients don’t return for follow-up appointments, highlighting the importance of maximizing both patient acquisition and retention efforts today.

### 3\. Highlight Its Impact on Growth

**Patient acquisition** powers growth by increasing new patient volume, which is essential for a successful practice. It strengthens revenue streams and positions the practice as a trusted provider. When your [**healthcare website is optimized for conversions**](https://www.inboundmedic.com/blog/how-to-generate-qualified-healthcare-leads/), it makes finding what patients are looking for easy. When you include an online booking option, you lower the barrier to entry for prospective patients to book their appointments. The same goes for **healthcare SEO**— prioritizing SEO can increase your online visibility and attract more **qualified patients**. **Social media marketing** is a third and equally potent resource. Facebook and Instagram are fun, informative places to spark conversation. This way, you can better connect with potential patients, answer their questions, and educate them with valuable content. Email marketing, though sometimes forgotten, has one of the highest ROI. Consumer email marketing studies find that every dollar spent on email marketing brings in an average return of $38. Referral programs are another big part of the equation. By incentivizing current patients to recommend their friends or family, practices can access a cost-effective, trustworthy pipeline of new patients. At the same time, targeted advertising campaigns and [**community outreach efforts**](https://rendia.com/resources/insights/3-outreach-strategies-for-eyecare-practices/) enable practices to reach specific demographics more effectively. Your practice should use [healthcare marketing strategies](https://www.inboundmedic.com/medical-lead-generation-strategies-for-converting-healthcare-leads), such as promotions or discounts, to generate more first-time patient leads. Making the patient intake process more efficient is just as vital. A seamless experience — from appointment booking to in-person check-in — creates a positive overall patient experience that makes patients more likely to return. In today’s **competitive healthcare landscape**, practices must regularly calculate their CAC and compare it to industry benchmarks to ensure their strategies are delivering a positive return.

## Importance of patient acquisition

The importance of **patient acquisition** goes much deeper than just getting people through the door of your practice. This process is ongoing and multifaceted. All five strategies work together to increase visibility, create trust, and set the stage for sustainable long-term revenue. In the sections below, we dive into the key factors that make up successful patient acquisition and how it can benefit your healthcare practice.

### Enhance Healthcare Practice Visibility

Gaining a stronger **online presence** is one of the best methods available to bring new patients through your doors. Currently, more than 30% of people search for their **healthcare providers** online and that percentage is increasing. Through a combination of technical SEO and content marketing, practices can make sure their services show up front and center in search results. Creating blog posts that address common health questions increases SEO. Simultaneously, putting up FAQ pages makes sense from **[a patient acquisition perspective](https://personifyhealth.com/what-we-do/patient-acquisition/)**, as they provide helpful information. An average dermatology or dental clinic could increase their appointment volume by 50%. They can do this by attracting potential patients to their website with targeted keywords like “skin cancer screening near me” or “invisalign near me”. Digital marketing isn’t just a magical diversion of resources. To make the most of your efforts, practices need to set a baseline investment level. As an example, allocating even a small part of the budget to Google Ads or social media ad campaigns can increase visibility exponentially. Finding the right balance between costs and expected returns is critical. Whether you’re **[targeting local audiences with](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/202297959811696?id=176276233019487) geographically-focused ads** or you’re providing an online promotion for first-time patients, patient acquisition can drive measurable growth. Controlling [**online reviews**](https://www.powerreviews.com/power-of-reviews-2023/) is one of the most important aspects of having a positive online reputation. Patients are often dependent on reviews in their search for a prospective healthcare provider. Going above and beyond with feedback—good and bad—shows a high level of accountability and concern, making your practice’s reputation more trustworthy.

### Build Trust with Potential Patients

It shouldn’t be surprising that having a structured framework for patient acquisition is critical for any medical practice. Establish the goals upfront! For instance, set a goal to increase new patient appointments booked by 10% within six months and identify key performance indicators to measure your progress in patient acquisition marketing goals. A clear patient care plan keeps every member of the team on the same page and allows for better coordination of care. Your front desk staff can be much more proactive in assisting patients when you introduce self-scheduling tools, enhancing the overall patient experience. In turn, the marketing team directs their efforts towards increasing site visits through effective online marketing strategies. Once you start operating with this framework, your efficiency is multiplied exponentially. It further helps establish your practice as the most reliable, reputable option in an increasingly competitive healthcare landscape. Delivering a top-notch patient experience each and every time fosters trust among your patients. This trust is essential, particularly as more than a third of patients shop for care online. A strong healthcare marketing CRM centralizes patient information, allowing you to gauge what works best to attract qualified patients and ensuring smooth communication with them.

### Improve Revenue and Sustainability

Patient acquisition is especially important because it directly affects financial stability. Every new patient is one more chance to deliver care that exceeds their expectations, fulfill a market need, and reinforce your brand. Aside from just bringing in patients, priorities need to shift toward establishing long-term connections that foster trust. Patient retention and acquisition go hand-in-hand. Patient acquisition is important to bring new patients in, but consistent engagement means they’ll come back when their competitors come calling. It’s this dual approach that fuels multi-year revenue growth, one of the keys to a sustainable practice. Self-scheduling options make this process even better. When patients can schedule an appointment online, the process is simplified with fewer administrative bottlenecks, leading to higher satisfaction. Practices that leverage these tools find they have much greater patient retention. Convenience is hugely important to many patients when it comes to choosing their healthcare provider.

## Patient Acquisition Versus Patient Tetention

### Define Patient Retention

**Patient retention** is about building a long-term relationship with the patients you already have. It’s literally all about ensuring they keep returning for their healthcare needs to your practice. It’s about establishing an overall feeling of trust and satisfaction that motivates patients to seek your care again in the future. Common retention strategies involve delivering regular communication, delivering tailored care, and resolving patient issues quickly and effectively. Take for example, the experience patients now receive with immediate response to questions via an online portal, phone, or email. Making sure your staff are friendly and helpful in responding to patient queries will go a long way in earning their continued loyalty. Retention includes continuing to cultivate the patient experience after that first appointment. Regular follow-ups, appointment reminders, and even wellness newsletters will help you stay top of mind with patients and strengthen their commitment to your practice. By prioritizing retention, practices of all types can create a loyal patient base. This loyal base produces reliable, recurring revenue and drives impactful word-of-mouth referrals. In reality, 31.2% of consumers look to their friends and family for healthcare provider recommendations. This data stresses the need for focusing on patient satisfaction, as your happiest patients will serve as your greatest practice advocates.

### Compare Goals of Acquisition and Retention

While **patient acquisition versus patient retention** have different functions, both are equally important to the overall success of a medical practice. And your digital strategy and execution are critical towards the success of both patient acquisition and retention. Since more than 30% of patients now search for their healthcare provider online, a robust digital strategy has never been more important. In today’s digital age, patient acquisition efforts have transformed well past the days of printing flyers or running a newspaper ad. Practices today use data analytics and other targeted tools to find and target the patients that best match their needs, and vice versa. The goal of retention is to ensure those patients continue to return. Where acquisition may bring patients in the door, retention means they stick around. Patient retention strategies are a win-win, saving time and money in the long run. It’s always less expensive to keep an existing patient than it is to acquire a new one. The two are not incompatible. Patient retention is a great reflection of how well your patient acquisition efforts are performing themselves. If patients leave after their first visit, it’s a clear indicator that your practice needs to address gaps in the patient experience.

### Discuss How They Complement Each Other

Patient acquisition and patient retention are powerful forces for good when you make them part of a cohesive strategy for growth. You can’t build a loyal patient base without a healthy balance of both. So, acquisition strategies need to focus on long-term engagement. Work on making a great first impression and make it easy to book an appointment. Patients today have more choices and demand more convenience. By offering online scheduling tools and direct messaging, you can have a major impact on their decision to return. Retention, in turn, helps acquisition directly. Happy patients are more likely to share their experiences on social media, leave a glowing review online, or recommend your practice to friends and family. These endorsements can significantly impact your acquisition efforts, especially in a digital landscape where reviews and ratings often influence decisions. Practices that do well on retention have more latitude to invest in more targeted, advanced acquisition techniques. When your patient retention efforts are consistently successful, you can allocate more time and energy to focus on attracting new patient demographics. You can do that by moving into new service lines, too.

## Effective strategies for patient acquisition

### Optimize Website for Conversions

In many ways, your healthcare website is the first impression that new patients will have of your practice. A clean, easy-to-use design ensures that visitors can quickly find what they need, enhancing their overall patient experience. Having strong calls-to-action (CTAs) such as “Book an Appointment” or “Contact Us” buttons front and center on each page is crucial for patient acquisition efforts. Integrating **online appointment scheduling** tools significantly streamlines the onboarding process for qualified patients, reducing drop-offs. Mobile responsiveness, fast loading time, and accessibility features for users with disabilities all contribute to a better user experience. For example, a new patient sign-up form that is as short and simple as possible, requesting only essential information, will greatly increase conversions and patient loyalty. Showcasing **positive patient reviews** and testimonials helps establish trust and credibility with potential patients. Additionally, prominently displaying insurance acceptance and treatment options on your homepage addresses common patient questions right away, supporting your healthcare marketing strategies.

### Leverage Social Media Platforms

When used effectively, social media can be an incredibly effective tool for patient acquisition. Social media platforms, such as Facebook or Instagram, are great for sharing practice announcements, posting informative and educational content, and connecting directly with your community. For instance, when you share success stories or behind-the-scenes glimpses of your practice, you’re humanizing your brand. Leverage paid promotions to reach key demographics, including local audiences looking for advanced care. Providing answers to patient questions in the comments or DMs demonstrates you’re listening and engaged. Even hosting periodic live Q&A sessions or webinars through tools like Facebook Live helps to establish your authority. Beyond that, it helps you respond to patient pain points as they occur.

### Focus on Search Engine Optimization

Search engine optimization (SEO) helps make sure your practice shows up in searches near you. Begin by ensuring your [Google Business Profile](https://www.google.com/business/) is fully optimized, with the correct location, contact information, and hours of operation. Use geographic keywords in your website content, like “Manhattan pediatric dentist.” Write blog posts that answer the most commonly searched questions about your services to draw in organic traffic. Technical SEO, being things like optimizing your metadata and alt tags on images, is important as well. In fact, a practice that shows up on the first page of search results is more likely to be clicked on by potential patients.

### Create Engaging and Informative Content

Not only does content marketing help you establish your credibility, it helps educate patients. Write a few blog posts, create videos, or design infographics that help break down and explain complicated medical subjects. For instance, a local dermatologist can shoot a short, 1 to 2-minute video on the warning signs of skin cancer. Creating educational content is a great way to build trust in your brand and establish yourself as a trusted authority. Provide downloadable guides or checklists, like “How to Prepare for Your Surgery,” to give patients additional value. Regularly updating content keeps your website fresh and encourages repeat visits.

### Build a Robust Referral Program

Patient referrals build a community of confidence. Provide rewards such as percentage discounts off their next visit for current patients who refer members of their family or circle of friends. For instance, if you’re a physical therapy clinic, you could offer a free consultation in return. Partner with other healthcare providers to refer patients back and forth, keeping patients healthy and your pipeline full. Developing custom thank-you cards for referrals will help you build deeper relationships with your patient base.

### Use Targeted Advertising Campaigns

Targeted ads are all about reaching the right people, at the right time, with the right message. Platforms like Google Ads allow you to bid on keywords related to your services, such as “urgent care near me. Social media advertisements allow you to target ads specifically by age, location, and interests. So, a fertility clinic would be able to target ads only to couples aged 25–40 living within a 10-mile radius. Measuring ad performance through metrics such as click-through rates (CTR) or cost-per-acquisition (CPA) will aid in improving future campaigns to achieve better results.

### Streamline Patient Intake Processes

Making patient intake easier creates a positive patient experience from the start. Provide online intake forms that patients can fill out prior to their appointment. This minimizes wait times and guarantees that all required information is gathered correctly the first time. Electronic health records (EHR) integration makes things move even faster. Simple guidance about what to bring with them, or what to expect on their first visit will go a long way to assuaging the concerns of new patients. For example, a simple checklist sent via email in advance of the appointment will reduce uncertainty.

### Offer Promotions and Discounts

Special offers bring new patients in the door and show existing patients their loyalty is valued. A dental practice, for example, may choose to promote $50 cleanings for new patients or run seasonal campaigns such as back-to-school check-ups. Bundling services, like offering a free consultation bundled with the treatment package, creates extra value. Making sure these offers are clearly promoted on your website or social media makes sure potential patients see them. Just make sure your promotions are in line with your practice’s pricing strategy to remain profitable.

### Engage in Community Outreach

A strong connection with the local community helps your practice’s reputation. Whether it’s hosting free health screenings, sponsoring local events, or partnering with schools for educational programs, grassroots efforts raise brand awareness. For instance, if you’re a pediatric clinic, host a free vaccination clinic in flu season. Engaging in community events shows your dedication to the health of your patients. It further assists in building connections with future patients who don’t need your services just yet.

## Managing online presence for patient acquisition

### Improve online visibility and rankings

A strong online presence is crucial for effective patient acquisition. Nowadays, patients often rely on search engines to research healthcare providers, preferring to explore their options independently rather than contacting staff directly. This shift emphasizes the importance of ranking on page one of search engine results pages (SERPs) for medical practices aiming to attract qualified patients. According to a recent study by Semrush, first-page results capture approximately 22.4% of their potential traffic simply by being listed on Google’s first page. This statistic indicates that healthcare providers who invest in an effective digital marketing strategy will have a significant advantage in winning new patients. To enhance healthcare SEO, it’s essential to create valuable website content that incorporates relevant keywords your **target audience** is searching for. Ensure that your pages are fast-loading and mobile-friendly. For instance, a dental practice in New York City might target keywords like “best family dentist in Manhattan” or “pediatric dental care near me.” This is where local SEO comes into play, as consistent information across digital directories like Google My Business and Yelp helps potential patients easily find and trust your practice. This uniformity not only increases trustworthiness but also improves search engine rankings, ultimately leading to higher patient growth and satisfaction. By focusing on both online and offline marketing strategies, practices can create a cohesive brand presence that resonates with their audience.

### Manage and respond to online reviews

Online reviews are increasingly the first and deciding factor in a patient’s decision to choose a healthcare provider. Positive reviews create a sense of trust and community, whereas negative reviews will scare potential patients away. While dealing with negative reviews can be a daunting task, it does provide a great opportunity to make amends. Research shows that 64% of patients are more likely to go back to a practice. They reward organizations that respond to their issues quickly and courteously. When a patient leaves a review regarding an appointment being delayed, meet them with compassion. By giving an answer, you’re demonstrating that you care about making their experience better. A thoughtful answer such as, “We apologize for your wait time. We’re taking a hard look at our process for scheduling to make sure this isn’t an issue moving forward.” A simple “please don’t hesitate to reach out to us directly to talk more” goes a long way. The more glowing reviews you collect, the more you’ll bolster your online reputation. Think about leaving a ✌🏽thank you✌🏽 note, with a gentle ask. Or, follow up by email with an easy-to-find link to your review site.

### Utilize self-scheduling options for convenience

Patients want convenience, and nothing is more convenient than being able to schedule your next appointment right from the app. Providing self-scheduling capabilities via your website or patient portal empowers patients to take more control over their healthcare experience. This capability frees up your administrative staff’s workload and caters to patients’ desires for autonomy and control while improving their experience. For instance, a dermatology clinic that integrates a user-friendly scheduling tool allows patients to select their preferred time slots without needing to call the office. This system boosts patient acquisition and can automatically remind patients, which lowers no-show rates and keeps your schedule tidy. Self-scheduling shows off a modern, patient-centric approach that impresses tech-savvy millennials while streamlining processes and increasing satisfaction across the board.

## Budget for effective patient acquisition

### Minimum Investment Requirements

The foundation of [any successful **patient acquisition strategy**](https://www.demandhub.co/articles/patient-acquisition/) rests on understanding the minimum investment necessary to yield tangible results. Every healthcare practice, whether large or small, must factor in operating costs. These patient acquisition methods encompass both traditional and digital marketing tools, including online advertising and outreach to patients. For instance, digital solutions like NexHealth, which offer customizable online scheduling capabilities, are essential for catering to today’s modern patients. This feature enables patients to schedule their own appointments in real-time, fostering convenience and trust right from the start, which is crucial for enhancing the overall patient experience. When calculating your Patient Acquisition Cost (PAC), focus on direct costs related to marketing and outreach, such as ad buys, content development, and any other paid media or services used to engage potential patients. This approach ensures that your **marketing efforts** are effectively targeted. Be cautious not to include unrelated overhead costs, like full staff wages, as these can skew the true PAC value. A solid understanding of this metric is vital for maximizing your budget and ensuring that funds are directed towards supporting your patient growth initiatives.

### Allocate Resources for Digital Marketing

That’s where digital marketing comes in—it’s a lifeline for successful patient acquisition. Over 30% of patients already look for their healthcare providers online, and this number continues to increase exponentially. Patient acquisition budgets should leverage search engine optimization (SEO), pay-per-click (PPC) advertising, and social media campaigns to effectively reach the most people with your budget. These tools do more than just boost your visibility—they help to establish several key touchpoints for potential patients to connect with your practice. The fall campaign, in particular, has shown remarkable effectiveness, bringing in the most patients for the least amount of patient acquisition dollars spent. If done properly, a targeted campaign in this window can do the most outreach at the least cost. Patient reviews and testimonials should play a key role in your digital strategy. Having a great reputation online and offline can make your job that much easier. Keep in mind, 31.2% of consumers place their trust in recommendations from friends and family.

### Balance Cost with Expected Returns

Finding the right balance between costs and expected returns is a living practice that requires deep analysis and continuous evolution. Your patient acquisition efforts begin the moment a prospective patient interacts with your medical practice. Whether that’s through your healthcare website, a post on social media marketing, or even a friend’s recommendation, it all plays a crucial role in attracting qualified patients. Focus on strategies that streamline the patient journey while still building trust. A user-friendly website, for instance, complete with convenient features like real-time online appointments, can enhance the overall patient experience and significantly improve your **patient acquisition rate**. In our fast-paced world, where distractions are everywhere, trust and patience are in short supply. To thrive, prioritizing patient satisfaction is essential for successful practice growth. Monitor what your current patients are saying, as their feedback can make or break your practice’s reputation. Implementing tools that facilitate patient communication and scheduling can maximize satisfaction, leading to a more loyal patient base over the long haul.

## Patient acquisition framework

### Define a Structured Approach

Patient acquisition in healthcare can be a complex, nuanced endeavor. It’s more than just bringing in new patients—it’s about connecting with the right patients in a meaningful way and building that trust. Taking the first step in a more structured approach starts with mapping the patient journey. Each one, from first conducting research online through to after-appointment follow-ups, makes an impact. For instance, 90% of patients consider online reviews as a factor before selecting a healthcare provider, highlighting the importance of maintaining a positive online reputation. This is no longer a nice-to-have but a must-have in today’s competitive healthcare landscape. An acquisition framework that’s built out in a structured way is rooted in data-driven insights, which can enhance patient loyalty. Through healthcare marketing CRM systems, providers can leverage technology to unify data from multiple sources. This means every interaction, from appointment scheduling platforms to electronic health records and social media marketing. This data helps identify the missing pieces that paint a complete picture of patient behavior and preferences, ultimately aiding in patient growth. When you customize your marketing messages to address specific patient concerns, you increase effectiveness. For example, prioritizing preventive care for families or chronic disease management for older adults can help make outreach efforts more targeted and relevant, aligning with patient acquisition marketing goals.

### Steps for Implementing the Framework

Building and implementing a **patient acquisition framework** involves several key steps. Initially, healthcare practices should evaluate their existing patient journey. By mapping out each interaction, you can identify gaps or opportunities to enhance engagement and improve the overall patient experience. For instance, if potential patients frequently abandon online scheduling forms, this indicates a usability issue that should be promptly addressed. Following this, it is crucial to establish a solid online presence, which includes having an optimized healthcare website, strong social media marketing efforts, and targeted digital marketing campaigns. Utilizing digital marketing strategies can further increase visibility through search engine results, social media, and internet ads. For example, a community clinic might run geo-targeted ads to attract interested patients within a 10-mile radius of their facility. The next step is to integrate a healthcare marketing CRM system. An ideal CRM should not only store patient data but also connect the dots across all touchpoints. For instance, if a patient researches a specific treatment on your website, the CRM should log that interaction and automate a follow-up email with additional information or an invitation for a consultation. Then it automates a follow-up email to them with additional information or a consultation invitation. Last but not least, constant monitoring and adaptation is important. We’ve said it many times before—patient acquisition is not static. By focusing on these areas, healthcare practices can enhance their **patient acquisition initiatives** and ultimately improve patient loyalty and satisfaction.

### Benefits of Using a Framework

A well-structured patient acquisition framework can provide a myriad of advantages for medical practices. It enhances the overall patient experience through improved patient communication across the continuum of care, ensuring that patients receive what they need when they need it. Patients who feel recognized as individuals and have their needs appreciated are more likely to become loyal patients and refer your practice to others. Additionally, a clear patient acquisition framework not only provides clarity but also maximizes efficiency. By automating administrative tasks, such as appointment reminders or follow-up emails, healthcare providers can dedicate more time to patient interactions. It also allows for more precise, targeted marketing efforts, saving valuable time and resources spent on generic marketing campaigns. Instead of sending a mass email to all patients about flu shots, practices can focus their efforts on specific target audiences, such as parents or senior citizens. Ultimately, a patient acquisition framework redefines how practices attract and retain qualified patients. This approach creates a more strategic, measurable, and patient-centric process that lays the groundwork for long-term growth, even in today’s competitive healthcare landscape.

## Conclusion

Patient acquisition often determines how well a practice grows and thrives. Well-crafted strategies attract the right patients in need of quality care and establish long-term credibility. Clear objectives and intelligent fiscal planning propel achievement. A robust online presence ensures that practices are reaching their ideal patients at the right time in their patient journey. This process is more than just crunching the numbers, it’s about engaging with people and understanding their needs. Each move you make in the direction of [a better patient acquisition process](https://www.klara.com/blog/why-patient-self-scheduling-is-necessity-in-healthcare) is an investment in your practice. Whether by making your website more patient-friendly, sharpening your message, or measuring your success, every little bit helps. It’s important to recognize that success in this area doesn’t happen overnight, but every change is a step toward sustainable growth. Regain your competitive edge by taking action now. Carefully developing your patient acquisition plan will set your practice up for long-term success.
