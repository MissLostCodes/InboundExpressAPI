For Medical Practices

## Transform Your Medical Practice With Our AI-Powered Patient Acquisition Systems.

We don’t just offer marketing services—we build **AI-Native web design and patient acquisition systems** designed for effortless scalability and consistent, high-value patient flow. Our approach isn’t about running ads or ranking on Google alone; it’s about implementing intelligent, automated AI-Native systems that work around the clock to attract and convert the right patients.

Our AI-driven acquisition framework includes predictive marketing automation, conversational AI, data-driven web design, Search Everywhere Optimization, persuasive AI-optimized copywriting and conversion rate intelligence, all strategically engineered to ensure your schedule stays full with the patients you want to treat.

Unlike outdated marketing strategies that rely on unpredictable lead generation, our system ensures a steady, automated pipeline of pre-qualified patients. While you focus on delivering exceptional care, our AI-driven algorithms continuously analyze patient behavior, optimize outreach, and refine conversion processes, so your practice thrives without the guesswork or marketing headaches.

At **Inbound Medic**, we believe that doctors, surgeons, and healthcare leaders are the true experts in their fields—our role is to amplify that expertise, not replace it. We don’t just build websites or run campaigns; we equip you with an **AI-powered marketing and sales infrastructure** that drives long-term, scalable growth on your terms.

Our mission is simple: build a high-performing AI-driven patient acquisition engine, automate your practice’s growth, and put you in full control—so you’re no longer dependent on agencies or short-term marketing hacks. Within 12-24 months, we help you achieve marketing self-sufficiency, ensuring your clinic continues to scale with lasting impact and unlimited ROI potential.

For Healthcare-Focused Private Equity Firms

## AI-Native Growth Infrastructure That Drives Scalable EBITDA, Not Just More Patients

Most PE-backed healthcare platforms suffer from the same drag: acquisition costs keep rising, marketing is inefficient, and patient volume isn’t predictable. Margins erode. Growth stalls. Multiples flatten.

We fix that — permanently.

Inbound Medic Growth Labs is the AI-native growth lab for private equity firms acquiring and scaling medical groups. We don’t run ads or “do SEO.” We deploy self-optimizing patient acquisition engines that compound platform value with each location, lead, and click.

We build and embed:

-LLM-powered demand infrastructure — replacing legacy marketing with AI-native systems that find, qualify, and convert patients at scale.

-Predictive acquisition models — that reduce CAC and unlock 3–8x ROI on underperforming portfolios.

-Multi-site optimization engines — that grow each asset while aligning with enterprise-level scalability and investor timelines.

Whether it’s urgent care, dental, derm, or diagnostics — our AI-native infrastructure turns fragmented clinics into data-refined, EBITDA-maximizing platforms. We future-proof growth by embedding intelligent systems that:

-Automate new patient flow across search, local, and referral channels

-Maximize LTV with retention, reactivation, and AI-driven lifecycle strategies

-Compress marketing costs through always-learning, autonomous systems

-Standardize scalable growth infrastructure across new rollups and add-ons

We’ve replaced marketing agencies at our client practices and delivered compounding returns with systems that outperform ad spend and scale with zero bloat.

We don’t sell tools. We build infrastructure that multiplies exit value.

This is AI transformation with teeth — not dashboards and demos. PE firms partner with us when they’re serious about driving platform-level growth, reducing human dependencies, and positioning for premium exits.

We’re not QuantumBlack. We’re what comes after — performance-driven, AI-native and ethics-aligned from day one.

## As the owner of a medical practice, does any of this sound familiar?

### You're Visible. But Are You Trusted?

You struggle to stand out in a crowded, noisy marketplace, making it hard for potential patients to recognize your expertise or see the real value of your services.

### No Reliable Patient Acquisition System

And it's costing you. You struggle with getting a consistent and reliable stream of new high-value patients every month. You feel stressed and fed up because you are not sure how to solve this.

### Your Marketing Isn’t Working And You Feel It.

You have lost faith because you already wasted too much money on marketing, but high-paying patients are still not finding their way to your practice.

### No Time For Learning AI, Tech & Marketing

We get it, you just want to help your patients and not be stressed about how to get new patients and keeping up with the ever-changing marketing and technology landscape.

## Client Results

We made Dr. Kate Brayman's website the **[#1 dental website in NYC and the #3 dental website in the USA](https://www.diamond-group.co/blog/20-best-ranking-dental-websites-in-2020)**. We also helped her sell her practice and relocate from Manhattan to Long Island, NY, after COVID-19.

![](https://www.inboundmedic.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Kate-Brayman-DDS-Best-Ranking-Dental-Website-768x544.png)![Kate Brayman DDS Best Dental Website Metrics](https://www.inboundmedic.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Kate-Brayman-DDS-Best-Dental-Website-Metrics-768x556.jpg)

### **Case Study: Installing a Compounding Patient Acquisition Engine for Kate Brayman DDS**

**The Challenge:**

- In 2018, Kate Brayman, DDS, was heavily reliant on cookie-cutter lead brokers like PatientPop and ZocDoc.
- Dr. Brayman lacked a consistent, scalable system to attract and convert high-value patients, limiting her practice’s growth potential.
- Her website had zero authority, no well-defined brand, and didn’t rank organically.
- She had minimal online visibility and inconsistent patient flow.
- Dr. Brayman lacked control, predictability and scalability of her monthly practice income.
- There are **[14,677 active dentists in NYC](https://www.op.nysed.gov/professions/dentists/license-statistics)** as of 2025, which makes it one of the toughest niches in one of the toughest markets.

**The Solution**:

- Implemented a data-driven SEO strategy targeting high-conversion keywords.
- Developed a conversion-optimized, data-driven and modern WordPress website that positioned Dr. Brayman as a leading authority.
- Launched a Patient Generation Engine to consistently attract high-value patients and procedures like Invisalign and Cosmetic Consultations.

**The Results**:

- Ranked [**#1 dental website in NYC** and](https://www.diamond-group.co/blog/20-best-ranking-dental-websites-in-2020) **[#3 in the USA](https://www.diamond-group.co/blog/20-best-ranking-dental-websites-in-2020).**
- She started with a Domain Rating of 0 and currently sits with a **Domain Rating of 32**, which is powerful for a local dental website.
- #1 rankings for **Invisalign**, **Dental Bonding, Full Smile Makeover** and several **Google Map Pack rankings**.
- Created a scalable lead flow that enabled Kate to sell her practice and relocate successfully to Long Island post-COVID-19.

- Helped relocate and re-target her domain from Manhattan to Long Island, NY, in 2022.
- Her practice still commands ownership of prime digital real estate in Google without the monthly retainer anymore.
- Dr. Brayman commands **over $20,000 of revenue-generating free organic traffic every month** that others must pay for via Google PPC.
- Dr Brayman will keep converting new patients monthly through her website, which is now her patient-generating engine.
- Dr. Brayman now has control, predictability and scalability of her monthly practice income.
- This, in turn, leads to reduced stress, higher quality of life and more peace of mind.

**Key Takeaways**:

- We turned Dr Brayman’s website into a long-term patient-generating engine.
- This is not “marketing”. This is infrastructure.
- We did this through digital strategy, branding, keyword research, data-driven web design, custom WordPress development, technical SEO, content strategy, copywriting and conversion optimizations based on our inbound marketing framework.
- Custom-designed her own long-lasting patient acquisition system that stays with her and standing the test of time.
- This demonstrates that predictable growth and consistent patient flow are achievable for any medical practice.
- Ultimately, we were only able to achieve success because Dr. Brayman is excellent at what she does and already had excellent reviews.
- Our strategies amplify excellence — if you’re great at what you do, we can help you scale your individual brand of excellence. But if the foundation isn’t strong, no marketing in the world can make it work.

![Consistent stream of patients - Icon - Inbound Medic](https://www.inboundmedic.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Consistent-stream-of-patients-Icon-Inbound-Medic-150x150.png)

### LLM Visibility Audit

We evaluate how visible your medical brand is inside AI platforms like ChatGPT, Gemini, and Perplexity. We uncover what AI says about you, identify missing data and competitor mentions, and deliver a strategic action plan to ensure your practice becomes the default answer when patients ask AI for care.

![Peace of mind and Joy - Icon - Inbound Medic](https://www.inboundmedic.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Peace-of-mind-and-Joy-Icon-Inbound-Medic-150x150.png)

### Digital Strategy & Branding

We craft a tailored digital growth strategy that aligns your brand, messaging and patient journey with how high-value patients discover and trust providers today through LLMs. From positioning to patient psychology, we ensure your practice stands out, builds authority and attracts ideal cases across both AI and traditional digital channels.

![](https://www.inboundmedic.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Become-an-authority-Icon-Inbound-Medic-150x150.png)

### AI-Native Web Design

We transform your website from a static brochure built for Google into a high-performing, AI-trained and dynamic **answer engine system** designed and optimized for LLM search, buyer intent and real-time education. Built for speed, trust, and machine-readability, your medical practice website becomes your top marketing asset—engineered for LLMs and to be cited by AI platforms like ChatGPT, converting high-value visitors into booked appointments around the clock without ongoing ad spend.

![Focus on what you are good at - Icon - Inbound Medic](https://www.inboundmedic.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Focus-on-what-you-are-good-at-Icon-Inbound-Medic-150x150.png)

### Technical SEO

Technical SEO is now about visibility inside LLMs, not just Google. We optimise your medical practice site’s structure, schema, RAG-files, speed and crawlability in neatly formatted machine-readable chunks to ensure AI models like ChatGPT, Perplexity, Claude and Gemini can ingest, understand and trust your content— making your practice more likely to be surfaced as the default answer patients see first.

![Focus on what you are good at - Icon - Inbound Medic](https://www.inboundmedic.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Focus-on-what-you-are-good-at-Icon-Inbound-Medic-150x150.png)

### Content Creation

We produce structured, authoritative content designed for ingestion by AI models like ChatGPT and Gemini. Every blog, guide and FAQ is written to train LLMs on your expertise—making your practice more likely to be cited and surfaced when patients ask AI platforms for trustworthy healthcare recommendations.

![Focus on what you are good at - Icon - Inbound Medic](https://www.inboundmedic.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Focus-on-what-you-are-good-at-Icon-Inbound-Medic-150x150.png)

### Prompt-Space Domination

We identify what your ideal patients are asking ChatGPT and engineer your digital footprint to become the answer. From GPT-optimised guides to micro-sites, we ensure your practice owns high-intent prompts—so you’re not competing for clicks, you’re leading AI-driven patient conversations at the source.

![Focus on what you are good at - Icon - Inbound Medic](https://www.inboundmedic.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Focus-on-what-you-are-good-at-Icon-Inbound-Medic-150x150.png)

### AI Agent Training Suite

We build and deploy custom-trained GPTs that represent your voice, philosophy, and services. These AI agents live on your site, available 24/7 to educate, pre-qualify, and convert patients—ensuring LLMs and users engage directly with your expertise, not just generic content or third-party directories.

![Focus on what you are good at - Icon - Inbound Medic](https://www.inboundmedic.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Focus-on-what-you-are-good-at-Icon-Inbound-Medic-150x150.png)

### Knowledge Graph Injection

We insert your brand into the public and structured data sources that LLMs use to generate answers—Wikidata, schema, metadata, and more. This gives AI systems the factual, structured signal they need to cite your practice accurately and frequently—amplifying authority and AI-driven discoverability.

The Founder

## Welcome. My name is Dev and I am the Founder of Inbound Medic

For over a decade, I’ve mastered the art of luxury web design and digital marketing, partnering with world-renowned brands like Chanel, Cartier, and Boucheron to help them connect with affluent audiences through data-driven, high-impact strategies.

Today, I bring that same precision and strategy to medical practices and aesthetic clinics — treating them like premium brands that deserve authority, recognition, and high-value patients. Because in healthcare, just like in luxury, it’s not about the service alone — it’s about the unique experience patients receive.

My focus is on designing long-lasting, AI-powered patient-generating systems that fill your calendar and elevate your distinction by refining every step of the patient’s journey. The result? Consistent, high-value patients who trust your expertise — so you can focus on what matters most: caring for your patients.
