# Why Word-Of-Mouth Marketing Is Not Enough To Grow Your Medical Practice

![word of mouth is not enough to grow your medical practice inbound medic](https://www.inboundmedic.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/word-of-mouth-is-not-enough-to-grow-your-medical-practice-inbound-medic.jpg)

While **word-of-mouth medical marketing** is effective, it alone is simply not enough to attract a consistent and predictable opportunity volume of new patients every single month to grow your practice at a steady rate.

This is why word of mouth is not enough to grow your medical practice.

### Fails to drive consistent opportunity volume

The key to driving steady growth in your medical practice business is to ensure a consistent supply of qualified leads filters into your sales pipeline month after month.

With word-of-mouth or referrals, your healthcare practice may be referred by an existing patient today, but it could potentially take the new referral several months or even years before they actually schedule an appointment with you. You may get five new patients through referrals next month, followed by nothing over the next six months.

This could potentially cripple your cash flow, which is the lifeblood of any business.

## Your inability to control the conversation

According to the **[Chatter Matters report](https://www.kmosek.com/wp-content/uploads/chatter-matters-research-fall2018.pdf)**, 71% of people make recommendations because of a positive experience. But even if your patients are praising your services to others, you don’t know exactly what they are saying about your medical practice brand.

Simply because your existing patients are raving about your healthcare services, it doesn’t mean they are speaking to the **right target audience** who requires your **niche-within-a-niche** **medical services**. And even if they are, their recommendation might not include key aspects related to your medical procedures that are required to convince these prospects to schedule an appointment with you.

Unless your referrals have a burning need for your specific niche-within-a-niche medical services exactly at the time of the referral and are convinced that you are the go-to medical expert, you have absolutely no control over getting them to schedule an appointment—let alone **converting them into paying new patients.**

## Limited reach

There is a limitation on the total number of patients you can acquire through referrals. And even when you are referred, there is a strong likelihood that these **prospects will search for you online in Google.**

On the other hand, your medical practice website and digital reputation are accessible and working for you 24/7 as and when your patients need you.

Hence, it is entirely customer-centric and designed to handle scale. Irrespective of how good you are at your niche-specific medical expertise, you are bound to lose qualified prospects **if you lack visibility online.**

## Even your referrals will conduct due diligence online

Even if your existing patients send you referrals, they will still **search for you, your brand name and your specific services online.**

As per the **[2018 Patient Access Journey Report conducted by Kyruus](https://www.kyruus.com/2018-patient-access-journey-report),** **91% of prospective new patients conduct online due diligence** after being recommended of a medical practice.

If these potential prospects are unable to find you and if your digital reputation is not great or non-existent, these prospects are probably not going to commit to scheduling an appointment with you. Since there is so much content readily accessible out there online from all your competitor providers, you are potentially losing patients who are turning to doctors who meet their specific and unique needs.

## Growth At A Much Slower Pace

When it comes to creating a steady system of consistent new patient acquisition every single month, it’s something you want to put in place and in action sooner than later.Unfortunately, when it comes to word-of-mouth referrals, repeat business or networking-related leads, you simply don’t know when these referrals will happen and when these prospects will feel the need to utilize such referrals.

An existing patient could refer you or your medical practice today to a new potential prospect, but it could take months or even years before the actual need arises for this new prospect to actually schedule an appointment with you. As such, if you are seeking to put in place a predictable and measurable system of generating consistent opportunity volume of a steady stream of new patient appointments every single month, then referrals are not that system.

In contrast, our **[medical marketing services](https://www.inboundmedic.com/medical-marketing-services/)** are focused on powering up, optimizing and turning your medical practice website into your number one marketing and sales machine such that it attracts complete strangers who are actively searching for your medical services, educates and qualifies them to then generate you a steady stream of new patient appointments every single month.

Please be mindful that it still takes a lot of effort and time to put this system in place. But once the initial period of heavy lifting is over in creating and optimizing your digital assets (your service pages and blog posts), your growth comes at an exponentially faster and more predictable rate than through word-of-mouth referrals.
