## How To Get More Patients? By Understanding Patient Acquisition

To bring in new patients, consider your [**medical practice**](https://www.inboundmedic.com/blog/healthcare-marketing-agency) [**website**](https://www.inboundmedic.com/blog/zocdoc-alternatives) your primary marketing and sales team asset. This outside-the-box perspective is vital for success. This viewpoint puts the spotlight on an often-underutilized tool that has the power to supercharge patient engagement, and thus conversions.

We strongly recommend building WordPress websites because it’s the best [content management system](https://www.inboundmedic.com/blog/medical-website-builder) (CMS) for medical practices. Combined with its flexibility and user-friendly interface, this helps you execute inbound marketing strategies, strengthening your online presence.

Investing in a strong [inbound marketing budget](https://www.inboundmedic.com/blog/marketing-for-plastic-surgeons) of at least $10,000/month is key. This budget needs to account for [website design](https://www.inboundmedic.com/blog/medical-marketing-agency-that-understands-stem-cell-therapy) and development, SEO, [content creation](https://www.inboundmedic.com/medical-marketing-services), paid ads, conversion optimization and analytics. In reality, it usually just quashes growth and sabotages your attempts to woo new patients.

### 1\. Define Your Target Audience

Getting to know your **prospective patients** begins with determining who they are, what they want, and what they need. By developing rich patient personas, you can identify the goals and hurdles that your future patients have to overcome.

A working mom with three kids under the age of six will likely require some leeway when it comes to appointment schedules. She’s not alone, either—during her visits, she prioritized greater childcare options.

Segmenting your audience by demographics, medical needs, and behavior helps make sure your marketing campaigns land with the right people. If you’re seeing that younger patients are leaning towards digital communication, then consider using social media as one of your main engagement channels.

Looking at past patient data reveals what happy patients have in common. In turn, this insight gives you the power to focus your messaging and optimize your marketing channels accordingly.

### 2\. Recognize the Importance of Patient Satisfaction

Keeping patient satisfaction as your number one priority is key. Implementing surveys after visits provides valuable insights into service quality and [areas for improvement](https://www.inboundmedic.com/blog/orthopedic-web-design).

A simple fix, like training your staff on customer service best practices, goes a long way to improving the patient experience. If you’re getting the comment that patients are being rushed through, that’s a sign that you need to change some processes.

Incorporating great patient [testimonials](https://www.inboundmedic.com/blog/the-best-healthcare-website-design-company) into your website, social media, and advertising communications establishes [trust and credibility](https://www.inboundmedic.com/blog/pharma-marketing). When prospective patients read about real experiences, they’re more likely to book an appointment with your practice.

By creating a follow-up system, you’ll show that you care about what patients have to say and that you’re always looking to improve your practice.

### 3\. Monitor Your Online Reputation

Keeping a close eye on your [**online reputation**](https://www.inboundmedic.com/blog/digital-marketing-for-plastic-surgeons) is important. Creating Google Alerts for your practice name helps you stay on top of when your practice name is mentioned or reviewed online.

By actively responding to positive and negative reviews alike, you’re highlighting your dedication to patient care. Prompting happy patients to leave their feedback on third party sites such as Google and Yelp can build your online image tremendously.

Regular audits of your digital footprint and making the changes you need to make will help you stay visible and perceived in the right way. Understanding **patient acquisition** is key, and an optimized [patient acquisition strategy](https://www.inboundmedic.com/blog/patient-acquisition-company) alone can result in an improvement to profitability of as much as 20%.

## Train Your Healthcare Website

Your website is the foundation of [your healthcare practice’s marketing plan](https://www.ama-assn.org/about/research/employed-physicians-now-exceed-those-who-own-their-practices). It serves as your chief marketing and sales officer, working 24/7 to attract and convert the most qualified leads into patients. This is why it’s so important that you make sure your website is more than just aesthetically pleasing; it needs to be user-friendly and informative!

Continuing to invest in a well-designed site leaves a better first impression for your potential patients. This makes a huge difference in their overall experience. Making frequent updates to your content makes your information timely and relevant, keeping visitors engaged and coming back for more.

### 1\. Treat Your Website as a Marketing Asset

It’s important to invest in **quality web design and functionality**. A well-designed online presence signals expertise and credibility. Using direct calls-to-action (CTAs), like “make an appointment,” lead website visitors where you want them to go—right to scheduling your services.

This might mean adding a **self-scheduling functionality**, empowering patients to act right away. By promoting your services prominently and clearly, visitors to your website will never be confused about what services you provide. Conducting regular audits of your website to find performance issues is essential to remove any barriers that can get in the way of user experience.

### 2\. Invest in SEO for Better Visibility

This is why conducting thorough **keyword research** is key to figuring out which terms potential patients are using to search for the services you provide. Optimizing your website content, titles, and meta description tags should be at the core of [your](https://www.smartinsights.com/search-engine-optimisation-seo/seo-analytics/comparison-of-google-clickthrough-rates-by-position/) [search engine rankings strategy](https://www.inboundmedic.com/blog/patient-acquisition-strategy).

Creating backlinks from credible authorities boosts your own domain authority and can help position your practice higher in search results. Finally, keep a regular, watchful eye on your SEO performance. Tune your strategies according to [analytics data](https://www.buxtonco.com/blog/whats-your-churn-a-smart-approach-for-patient-retention) to keep your website competitively visible.

### 3\. Enhance User Experience and Design

Making navigation as easy and intuitive as possible helps visitors get the information they need quickly and without aggravation. By using compelling imagery and multimedia, you’ll have the opportunity to engage your audience and communicate your most important messages.

Quick loading times are key to reducing bounce rates and improving overall user experience. By implementing accessibility features, you are helping to make sure that your website serves all patients—especially those with disabilities.

### 4\. Implement Chatbots for Immediate Response

Implementing **chatbots** on your [healthcare website](https://www.inboundmedic.com/blog/healthcare-web-design-services/) offers immediate responses to frequently asked questions, so patients have the information they need right when they need it. Chatbots eliminate the back and forth of [appointment scheduling](https://financesonline.com/appointment-scheduling-software-statistics/), and they can help gather [patient information](https://www.inboundmedic.com/blog/medical-marketing-agency-that-understands-stem-cell-therapy), making the intake process more efficient.

Continual revisions to chatbot scripts ensure that the information is continuously updated, making it more relevant, informative, and helpful to patients.

### 5\. Create Location-Specific Pages

Creating individual pages for every practice location helps with [local SEO](https://www.score.org/resource/infographic/infographic-small-business-charitable-giving-big-impact-local-communities) and makes it easier for patients nearby to find you. Adding language to highlight services provided at each site reflects the local community’s needs and helps focus on a diverse audience.

Showcasing your [community involvement](https://www.inboundmedic.com/blog/mommy-makeover-marketing-for-plastic-surgeons) and events helps build trust and rapport with potential patients. Including [location-based keywords](https://www.inboundmedic.com/blog/seo-for-plastic-surgeons) increases the search visibility for each individual practice location.

## Utilize Digital Marketing Strategies

If you want to win more patients, consider your medical practice website your best marketing and sales person. Because it’s key to your success! **A professional, well-optimized website** is your best first impression. Your website is more than just a portfolio for the services you provide.

Content management systems (CMS) WordPress is the most widely used platform among medical practices. It’s its flexibility and functionality that are the best bedrock for [smart digital marketing strategies](https://www.graffiti9.com/blog/dental-digital-marketing/). Building a strong inbound marketing budget—ideally a minimum of $10,000 per month—is imperative.

This budget needs to include web design, development, SEO, content creation, [paid advertising](https://www.usps.com/business/advertise-with-mail.htm), conversion optimization and analytics. Investing in [low-quality web design and marketing services](https://www.gmrwebteam.com/medical-marketing-services) can be an equally dangerous mistake. These services are a drain on your resources and produce little to no impactful work.

### 1\. Leverage Paid Advertising for Quick Results

Paid advertising offers instant exposure for your practice. Google Ads can be great, giving you the ability to target specific keywords that people search when they’re looking for your services. This guarantees that your potential patients discover you first when they’re looking for the healthcare options that best suit their needs.

Social media ads, which can be dynamically targeted to users based on interests and behaviors, are another way to reach a large audience and fast. Continuously monitoring your ad performance is key, and sometimes changing your targeted audience or messaging after reviewing analytics can improve performance and engagement.

Allocating your budget strategically across multiple platforms helps you get the most reach and engagement.

### 2\. Engage Patients Through Social Media

Engaging social media accounts **build meaningful relationships** with your existing patients and future ones. Consistent posting of educational content, updates of practice developments, and inspiring patient success stories helps build goodwill in the community.

Social media is an ideal space to dispel myths and address patient questions and concerns in real time. Targeted campaigns on platforms like Facebook and Instagram can help bring in new patients, expanding your practice’s reach and influence.

### 3\. Publish Valuable Content Regularly

A content calendar ensures that the most impactful, healthcare-related articles are regularly published. Answering frequently asked patient questions with informative blog posts positions your practice as a helpful authority.

By providing educational resources and tips, you can help boost your credibility even more. By encouraging the sharing of your content, you can help expand your reach and attract new patient leads.

### 4\. Use Video Marketing to Connect with Patients

Video marketing is one of the best ways to create meaningful interactions with your patients. Creating engaging video content on your services and procedures makes the healthcare experience less intimidating.

By distributing patient testimonials as videos, you can increase the credibility and relatability of your hospital or practice. Hosting live streaming Q&A sessions really helps you to form a personal bond with your audience.

Planning video marketing content around search intent can ensure the content answers viewers’ questions and generates interest in the brand.

### 5\. Explore Email Marketing Campaigns

An email list of [existing and prospective patients](https://www.mgma.com/deep-dives/maximizing-patient-access-and-scheduling) is an effective way to keep them informed and engaged. Consistent newsletters featuring office news, health advice, and special promotions help maintain a strong bond with patients.

By segmenting your email list, you can send more tailored messages based on patient interests and demographics, boosting engagement and conversions. Analyzing email campaign performance allows you to hone your strategies and tactics for improved email marketing success in the future.

## Build Strong Patient Relationships

Building strong patient relationships should be one of the cornerstones of any modern medical practice’s strategy to improve patient acquisition and retention. An [**effective healthcare marketing**](https://www.inboundmedic.com/blog/digital-marketing-for-healthcare) plan emphasizes the medical practice website as the front line in this effort, acting as your primary marketing and sales tool. By viewing your website through this lens, you can elevate its importance and invest wisely into building an effective website that attracts potential patients.

WordPress stands out as the best content management system (CMS) for medical practices. Its user-friendly features align seamlessly with inbound marketing strategies, making it ideal for healthcare marketing. Begin your inbound marketing budget at $10,000 a month, ensuring you include costs for web design, [search engine optimization](https://www.inboundmedic.com/blog/medical-practice-marketing-costs), content creation, and display advertising.

Cutting corners with low-quality alternatives can harm your medical marketing efforts more than delivering nothing at all. Therefore, investing in [compelling web design](https://www.webfx.com/blog/web-design/user-experience-matters-marketing/) and smart marketing solutions is crucial for enhancing **patient engagement programs** and ensuring a successful healthcare journey.

### 1\. Foster Patient Engagement Techniques

Regular, open communication with patients helps strengthen [patient trust and rapport](https://www.inboundmedic.com/blog/mommy-makeover-marketing-for-plastic-surgeons). Getting patients involved in shared decision-making is very important. When you collect their insights through surveys and feedback forms, you’re making it clear that their opinion really counts.

Organizing community events and workshops can effectively educate patients about available services while fostering a sense of belonging and community. Designing loyalty programs that reward patients for referring others and making return visits encourages a culture of appreciation and engagement.

Leveraging [patient portals](https://www.inboundmedic.com/blog/medical-practice-marketing) is another effective strategy. Patient portals are a powerful tool for improving communication, enabling patients to manage appointments with ease and access information effortlessly.

### 2\. Establish a Referral Program

A streamlined and organized referral program incentivizes your existing patients to send new ones your way. By clearly communicating the benefits of the program, you increase participation and happy patients can become a powerful advocacy tool for your practice.

Keeping track of the referrals allows you to measure your program’s effectiveness and identify which strategies are the most effective. Taking the time to thank patients who refer others shows you value the relationship and will help cultivate loyalty.

This, in turn, increases the profitability of your practice.

### 3\. Encourage and Manage Patient Reviews

Because of this, actively requesting reviews from satisfied patients is one of the most important strategies for establishing a positive online reputation. Making it simple to get to review platforms in follow-up communications makes it easier for patients to leave reviews about their experiences.

Replying to all reviews, good and bad, shows you care about your patients and their needs. This type of engagement shows that you truly value feedback. Beyond that, it allows you to identify where you can improve, ultimately making the patient experience a better one.

## Address Challenges and Costs

In this new, competitive landscape of healthcare marketing, finding and successfully attracting patients today can be a daunting challenge. Addressing these challenges and the costs associated with [**medical practice growth strategies**](https://www.inboundmedic.com/blog/dermatology-marketing/) are crucial for medical practice owners. This section will detail how to get the most out of your medical marketing efforts, while highlighting the importance of cultivating a strong online presence.

### 1\. Acknowledge Potential Shortcomings

Transparency is key when trying to bring an honest evaluation of your existing marketing efforts. By acknowledging what you don’t know, you can start to figure out what you need to work on. If your website isn’t bringing in leads, for instance, that’s an opportunity to go back to the drawing board and reimagine your web presence.

Understanding that every marketing tactic won’t deliver immediate outcomes is just as crucial. Other strategies just take a while to gain traction. When you’re proactive with addressing [patient concerns](https://www.inboundmedic.com/blog/why-trust-matters-in-medical-practice-marketing) before they leave the office, you build trust and avoid bad Yelp reviews.

For example, if survey responses show that patients are frustrated with long wait times, try adding online scheduling to improve patient experience. [Real-time feedback mechanisms](https://www.inboundmedic.com/blog/why-winning-new-patients-is-harder-than-ever), like [patient experience surveys](https://www.healthyagingpoll.org/reports-more/report/use-and-experiences-patient-portals-among-older-adults), provide a way to identify areas that need improvement so they can be addressed right away.

### 2\. Understand the Investment Required

While investing in smart and creative marketing tactics can be a significant up-front financial investment, it’s an investment that pays dividends in the future. A strong inbound marketing budget, ideally at least $10k per month, is essential. This budget would include any necessary services like website design, SEO, content creation, and advertising.

Think about the quality-of-life and economic-development benefits that would flow from these investments. For example, optimizing your website might attract more patients to contact your practice, which increases your revenue streams.

Keeping a constant finger on the pulse of your ROI will help you focus your marketing dollars on what’s making you the most money.

### 3\. Discuss the Pricing for Effective Strategies

Whether it’s digital ads or direct mail, understanding the costs involved with each is key. Digital advertising or search engine optimization (SEO) – The cost for these tools can range significantly, but they are critical for patient acquisition.

Investing in software that improves critical patient communications, or manages multiple appointments at once will do wonders to save your practice time and energy. Budgeting for ongoing marketing initiatives is crucial to maintaining momentum.

For example, allocating monthly funds for [social media advertising](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_network_advertising) can help keep your practice top-of-mind for prospective patients. Evaluating the cost against the expected increase in patient volume allows you to assess the overall value of your marketing strategies.

## Conclusion

Getting more patients is all about employing the most effective strategies that make sense for your practice. Your website has to dazzle, putting your best services forward and providing value while building trust with future patients. This is where digital marketing comes in, allowing you to connect with the people who need your services most at the moment they’re searching. By building strong, genuine relationships with your patients, they’ll return to your practice and tell others about their positive experiences.

The more you know about challenges, the better prepared you can be to face them, and budgeting for unexpected costs will ensure your budget stays in line. So get to work, before it’s too late. Make these the focus of your efforts to build a successful practice. Take these concepts, tailor them to your practice, and see your new patient count flourish. We’ll help your practice become the top healthcare destination in your community.
