ABOUT THE FOUNDER

## My name is Dev and I am the Founder of Inbound Medic

For years, I honed my craft in luxury web design and digital marketing, helping iconic brands like Chanel, Cartier and Boucheron connect with their affluent audiences through high-impact strategies. Now, I bring that same precision to medical practices and aesthetic clinics — treating them like luxury brands that deserve distinction, visibility, and high-value clients. Because premium branding isn’t just about the product or service; it’s about the experience your patients get to enjoy. My focus is on custom-designing [patient-generating systems](https://www.inboundmedic.com/medical-marketing-services/) that don’t just fill your calendar but elevate your practice’s reputation by imagining a better and more unique buyer's journey and experience for your patients, so you can focus on what matters most — caring for your patients.

At Inbound Medic, we are very counterculture. We believe that the traditional agency-client relationship is broken. So, we are different. We believe doctors, surgeons, healthcare leaders, and medical practices understand their patients, their industry, their niche and their high-value better than any external agency or consultant ever could. Our mission isn't to be an agency — it’s to be your growth partner and empower you. We go beyond building websites and running campaigns; we custom-design patient acquisition systems that harness your expertise and amplify it for scalable, predictable growth.

Our approach is simple: we do the heavy lifting, craft a high-performing patient generation engine, and then hand over the keys — giving you full control without long-term agency dependencies. Within 12–24 months, we help you achieve marketing self-sufficiency, so your practice can scale on your own terms, with lasting impact and an unlimited ROI upside. Because real growth isn’t about paying an agency forever — it’s about designing and investing in a dividend-generating asset that stands the test of time and keeps delivering for you.

## Who We Are Looking To Work With

As an established doctor, surgeon, medical practice and leader, you’ve built something from scratch — a thriving medical practice that pulls in $2M+ annually. You didn’t get here by accident. You’re driven, calculated, and cautious about who and what you invest your time and money into.

At this stage, your time is your most valuable asset. You don’t waste it on vanity metrics or hollow promises. You want results — predictable, scalable and high-value results.

That’s where we come in.

We specialize in helping high-earning medical practices like yours turn their websites into patient-generating engines that run 24/7. No fluff. No gimmicks. Just proven systems that bring in more of your ideal patients — on autopilot.

But let’s be real—this isn’t for everyone.

We work best with medical practice owners who:

- Have hit the $2M+ annual revenue mark and want to scale strategically.

- Value high-converting, data-driven systems over one-size-fits-all solutions.

- Demand transparency, integrity, and measurable ROI.

**Built to Last: Long-Term Growth Without Ongoing Costs**

We don’t just build marketing systems — we build premium digital assets that stand the test of time. Our patient acquisition systems are designed with longevity in mind, meaning that after an intensive 18-24 month build, your practice will have a fully optimized, self-sustaining patient generation engine. And we will have trained you to update and manage it all in-house attaining full marketing self-sufficiency.

No constant tweaks. No ongoing external agency fees. Once built, your system keeps delivering high-value patients for years to come — without recurring costs. It’s a one-time, strategic investment for long-term, predictable growth.

- **Full-Service Inbound Marketing:** From Search Everywhere Optimization (the new SEO) and paid ads to high-converting web design and AI marketing automation.


**Is This You?**

You’re selective. You don’t make decisions lightly. You value precision, control, and proven ROI.

If you’re ready to:

- Attract more high-value patients.

- Develop a reliable patient acquisition system.
- Build scalable, predictable revenue streams.
