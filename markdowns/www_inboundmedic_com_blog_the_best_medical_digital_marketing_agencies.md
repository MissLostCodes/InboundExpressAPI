# 6 Qualities To Look For In The Best Medical Digital Marketing Agencies

![the best medical digital marketing agencies](https://www.inboundmedic.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Untitled-design-2.jpg)

The HubSpot Partner Program celebrated its 10th anniversary in 2020. This program allowed a few branding, PR, web design and [traditional marketing agencies](https://thriveagency.com/) to gain [inbound marketing methodology certification](https://www.inboundmedic.com/blog/pharma-marketing/) via HubSpot. Ultimately, they became the first [inbound marketing agencies](https://www.inboundmedic.com/blog/medical-practice-marketing-costs/) to come onto the market. It was August 2009 when the program launched and they have seen both exponential and rapid growth since that time. They began with 14 agencies and now have more than 5,500 just 10 years later. Now, this is great for the industry, but as a consumer, it gives you a bit more work because you have a lot more to choose from when you are seeking the best [medical digital marketing agencies](https://www.inboundmedic.com/blog/healthcare-digital-marketing-agency/) to work with. The ultimate question is, how do you find the right inbound marketing agency to help your [medical practice](https://www.inboundmedic.com/blog/medical-practice-marketing/)? This article will provide you with the knowledge you need to explore [healthcare-focused inbound marketing agencies](https://www.inboundmedic.com/blog/healthcare-marketing-agency/) and determine the best fit for your medical practice. There are six traits that you want to look at while performing your search. However, before we dig into the traits that you want to examine, there are a couple of other traits that will not be discussed in this article. The first one is ROI or being able to drive results. The reason you do not need to worry about this is because any good [inbound medical marketing agency](https://www.inboundmedic.com/about-us/) that you talk to will provide a history of their success. They will show you case studies of past and current clients to show you what they are capable of. Should an agency not give you this information, you will want to cut ties and look elsewhere. The next is that they practice what they preach. When you are looking at inbound marketing agencies for your practice, they will do inbound marketing. Of course, some will be more successful than others. Instead of looking at what they do, look at how they do it. This will help you to best determine if they are the right fit for your practice. While some might argue that these two traits are the most important, and they do hold a lot of significance, you want to look deeper to make the best decision. Those two traits are necessary for any business to grow and thrive. You want to look at traits that are more exclusive to inbound medical marketing agencies to see what they are truly capable of.

## 6 Qualities of the Best Medical Digital Marketing Agencies

### Trait \#1: They Are Teachers

One of the best traits to look for in this type of agency is that they are teachers. They will nurture and extract your knowledge while also challenging your assumptions. The best agencies essentially emancipate themselves over time because they teach you what they do and how to do it. Eventually, those that are responsible for marketing activities in your medical practice will be able to do exactly what the agency was doing so that you can save the money and reinvest it elsewhere in your practice. You can definitely still keep them around to help you or even to continue doing all the work. However, you will eventually have this choice. This is because the best agencies view it as their responsibility to help you to become a marketer, leader, salesperson or all of the above. As you continue to work with inbound medical marketing agencies, you should feel empowered. This feeling should start with your first interaction and continue on as you work together. In addition to getting the [marketing results](https://www.inboundmedic.com/mommy-makeover-marketing-for-plastic-surgeons) that you desire for your practice, you should also be able to step back and say, “wow, I have learned a lot and feel confident that I could do these tasks on my own.” Ask yourself the following questions when you are determining if an agency possesses this trait: -With every interaction I have with the agency, am I learning at least a single thing? -With each interaction, am I increasing my competence and intelligence?

### Trait \#2: They Are Not Wasting Any Time

The best agencies do not function like an agency, but more like a software company when they are at the top of their game. You will notice that they operate lean and they value the principles that are associated with this. These include gathering data, optimizing, launching fast and testing. Also, they continue to repeat these frequently. They believe that getting their clients results relies on learning what to and not to do. Ultimately, this ensures a faster return on investment for their clients. They will not need weeks or months to develop a strategy or to determine the target market for their clients. Ultimately, they know that perfection does not work for any medical practice, so they just start digging in from day one to get the wheels turning for you. Explore the execution process of [the inbound medical marketing agency](https://blog.xoxoday.com/marketing/influencer-marketing-tools/) to determine if they have this trait. Talk to their [sales team](https://www.inboundmedic.com/blog/how-to-generate-qualified-healthcare-leads/) or explore their [website](https://www.inboundmedic.com/blog/medical-marketing-agency-that-understands-stem-cell-therapy/) to get more details about how quickly they get to work. This will help you to determine if the speed of their work aligns with the goals of your practice.

### Trait \#3: Your Entire Practice is a Part of the Marketing Process

The best **[healthcare marketing agencies](https://www.inboundmedic.com/healthcare-marketing-agency-vs-in-house-medical-marketing-which-is-better)** know that everyone in the practice has to be excited and engaged for the process to work. All of your staff must buy into what they are selling to achieve the best results. This includes everyone from the cleaning staff to the person who owns the practice. Ultimately, inbound medical marketing relies on everyone agreeing with the strategy and understanding its importance. They should also know what the [marketing goals](https://www.inboundmedic.com/blog/online-marketing-for-plastic-surgeons/) are. Without cooperation from everyone in the practice, there is a high chance of failure. The **[top healthcare marketing agencies](https://www.inboundmedic.com/healthcare-marketing-agency-vs-in-house-medical-marketing-which-is-better)** will ensure that everyone in your practice understands why their roles are essential and the what and how of all the actions they are taking. This clarity enables each staff member to contribute content, ensures accountability, and facilitates the right meetings so that you can achieve the results you need. These agencies will do the following when you are going through the sales process with them: They will ask you to bring along several of your staff members during discussions so that everyone can contribute. Some of the best [healthcare marketing firms](https://www.inboundmedic.com/the-best-medical-marketing-companies) will decline a meeting if you do not include some staff members in the sales conversations. Instead of saying “ [marketing team](https://www.inboundmedic.com/blog/biotech-marketing-agency/)” or “sales team,” they will refer to the entire group as the “revenue team.” They emphasize how the first engagements focus on developing a sense of direction and common language for the whole team before everyone can get started. This collaborative approach is essential for **healthcare success** and helps align the goals across various healthcare organizations. In summary, the right **[healthcare marketing agency](https://www.inboundmedic.com/healthcare-marketing-agency-vs-in-house-medical-marketing-which-is-better)** fosters an inclusive environment where all team members understand their roles in the larger [marketing strategy](https://www.inboundmedic.com/blog/plastic-surgery-marketing/). This ensures a cohesive effort towards achieving the objectives of the healthcare business.

### Trait \#4: They Have a Wealth of Connections with Experts Throughout the Industry

You will find that the best agencies have a wide array of connections with people who are in the industry and those who are able to provide complementary services. This makes it a lot easier to tackle all elements of medical marketing, including those that are not specifically offered by the inbound medical marketing agency that you are working with. Their network may include a variety of professionals, such as those who have skills in the following: -Public relations -Paid advertising -Video production -Technical SEO -Programmatic advertising -Events These are just some examples, as they may work with many other professionals as well. When they have a large network, this can save you a lot of time and money as the agency will essentially be a one stop shop for all of the marketing needs. It could also result in you being able to get special offers that would otherwise not be available to you if you sought out these services separately. To get more information about an agency’s network, you can do a few different things: -Head over to the “Partner” page on their website to see who they might work with -Take a look at their blog and read some articles. Pay special attention to who wrote them because these could be professionals from their network -Should you be a part of the sales process, talk about other types of company or [marketing initiatives](https://www.inboundmedic.com/blog/biotech-marketing-agency/) to see if they have someone in their network that offers them

### Trait \#5: They Make Employee Happiness and Engagement a Priority

The [employee engagement equation](https://www.inboundmedic.com/blog/plastic-surgery-web-design/) is what has to be considered here. It says that when employees are engaged they are happy and happy employees mean happy customers which results in a company that is able to remain in business. These practices might seem like something that all businesses should strive for, many do not. When you think about your medical practice, your patients are obviously a top priority. However, it is critical that you also consider all of the members of your staff and ensure that they are engaged. A happy staff will be the best thing for your patients. In fact, there are studies that show that patients have greater satisfaction when the practice employees are more fulfilled. When your staff knows that you value them, they are going to be more eager to work hard and keep your patients happy. Now, it can be tricky to find a medical marketing agency who focuses on this trait. While you can look at their “team” or “culture” pages to get a basic idea, you will need to dig a bit deeper to find the total picture. Search the name of the inbound medical marketing agency on the internet and look for employee reviews on websites like Glassdoor. This is where people are able to put honest reviews of their employers and their experiences with them. You also want to look for awards, such as “Best Place to Work.” This is usually displayed on the company website.

### Trait \#6: For Their Buyers, They Eliminate Risk and Friction

The best medical digital marketing agencies will do everything that it takes to make it easy for practices to get started with utilizing their services. They will also make it easy to terminate your engagement in the future should you decide to do this. They understand that inbound marketing is not an inexpensive venture and there are times when a practice just might not be able to continue with their engagement. Of course, the best agencies also know that they are not the best fit for every practice, so should this be the case, they will allow you to terminate your agreement. They help to eliminate friction by doing the following: -The pricing model is simple and understandable -The contracts are not binding or complex They help to eliminate risk by doing the following: -They guarantee their work -They educate during the process instead of focusing on selling You are in control with the best agencies. They help to guide you along the way, but you are in charge during the entire process. The ultimate goal is to teach and nurture you so that you are able to take the marketing reins in the future.
