![](https://www.inboundmedic.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Healthcare-Marketing-Agency-vs-In-House-Medical-Marketing.jpg)

Choosing between [a](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6685306/) [**healthcare**](https://www.inboundmedic.com/blog/online-marketing-for-plastic-surgeons) [**marketing agency**](https://www.inboundmedic.com/blog/cosmetic-surgery-marketing-agency/) and building an [**in-house**](https://www.inboundmedic.com/blog/the-best-medical-marketing-companies) [**medical marketing team**](https://www.inboundmedic.com/medical-marketing-services) is a critical decision for scaling your practice. Each option has distinct benefits, based on what you want to accomplish, how much time and money you have to invest. Agencies are known for their specialized expertise and quicker turnaround, whereas **in-house teams** are known for more control and tailored solutions. Knowing what you value most, what you can afford, and what your long-term strategy looks like will help you identify the best fit. This article breaks down each approach to inform your decision and help you get the most out of your ROI.

## Key Takeaways: Healthcare Marketing Agency vs In-House Medical Marketing

- [In-house medical marketing](https://www.inboundmedic.com/why-private-equity-healthcare-marketing-failures-happen-and-solutions) allows you greater control and flexibility over your overall [marketing strategy](https://www.inboundmedic.com/blog/plastic-surgery-marketing). It allows for speedier communication and helps build a more personal attachment to your brand’s personality. It usually takes a lot of cash upfront investment and can be difficult to scale at all.
- Developing an in-house team means you’ll need to hire for specialized roles like content managers, SEO experts, and videographers. In the U.S., the salaries for these positions quickly climb above six figures per year.
- [**Healthcare marketing agencies**](https://www.inboundmedic.com/) bring a deep bench of specialized skills. What’s more, they can turn around campaigns quickly, making them a cost-effective choice for temporary initiatives or when your in-house resources are otherwise occupied.
- Agencies may not be as familiar with your brand, leading to longer communication and review cycles. Depending too heavily on an outside partner can deprive you of needed control over your marketing direction.
- Deciding between **in-house marketing** and an agency depends on factors like your budget, long-term growth plans, your team’s existing expertise, and how much flexibility and control you prefer in your marketing efforts.
- Get an honest understanding of your immediate needs and staff capabilities. Determine whether you value speed or customization to help you identify the approach that best meets your objectives.

## What Is In-House Medical Marketing?

In-house medical marketing consists of marketing that is done by physicians, surgeons, or owners of a [medical enterprise](https://www.inboundmedic.com/blog/medical-website-design-cost/). They bring on specialized staff to manage and execute their marketing efforts. This practice is all about the “A” team. The other option is to put all that responsibility on an individual in-house coordinator to handle website upkeep, SEO, content development, social media management and analytics. Because it places the control literally in your hands, and offers you instant access to the marketing process. It also creates challenges and considerations of its own.

### Definition of In-House Marketing

In-house marketing is an approach that brings every component of marketing in-house to the practice. This strategy removes the need to outsource to outside agencies. It gives you full access to the team’s efforts, allowing for alignment with your practice’s unique goals and daily operations. For example, an in-house marketing coordinator can quickly update your website with announcements or seize opportunities to promote special services based on real-time patient feedback. This kind of nimbleness helps ensure that the marketing remains tightly coupled with the practice’s vision. The reality is that the work required goes far beyond what one person can reasonably do well. A comprehensive marketing strategy requires specialists in web design, SEO, data analysis, paid advertising, and more. When these responsibilities are spread across just one or two people, that can result in half-hearted execution. Perhaps your marketing coordinator is a whiz at social media campaigns. They often lack the technical know-how to fine-tune your website so it can convert more patients.

### How In-House Marketing Works

In-house medical marketing works under a predetermined monthly budget that includes their salaries, benefits, and necessary tools or software. This predictability makes financial planning much easier, but the costs can escalate rapidly. The average salary for a [healthcare marketing coordinator](https://www.inboundmedic.com/blog/what-is-lead-generation-in-healthcare/) is around $69,500 annually. This figure doesn’t even factor in benefits, training, or the costs for tools such as SocialClimb. Having SocialClimb as a partner really helps us tie campaigns back to the goals of the practice, in real-time. Don’t just focus on the upfront investment. When work is typically scheduled a month out or more, it can pose added constraints. Ad-hoc campaigns or last-minute updates, like a flash promotion for elective procedures, will usually cost more or take longer. In-house teams are able to respond quickly to new immediate needs. Without the help of outside professionals, they fail on the bigger or more intricate projects.

### Common Roles in an In-House Team

Common positions on an in-house marketing staff would be marketing coordinator, graphic designer, and content specialist. A coordinator oversees the entire marketing plan, a designer focuses on visual assets, and a content specialist handles blogs, newsletters, and social media. This division involves hiring not one, but several professionals, which can bust budgets. A one-person coordinator might find it impossible to cover all these bases, leading to holes in expertise and execution. For instance, a coordinator who excels at copywriting may not have the technical know-how to oversee an analytics infrastructure.

## What Is a Healthcare Marketing Agency?

A healthcare marketing agency focuses on delivering customized [marketing strategies](https://www.inboundmedic.com/blog/marketing-for-surgeons). These solutions are purpose built for medical practices, surgeons and healthcare enterprises. These agencies use their knowledge of healthcare regulations and patient privacy laws. They introduce best-in-class marketing strategies to ensure practices grow sustainably and ethically. By developing a partnership with an agency, practices can tap into a deep well of specialized expertise. This know-how and rich resources aren’t commonly accessible by in-house efforts. Read on to learn what makes up a healthcare marketing agency, how they function, and what services they offer.

### Definition of a Marketing Agency

A [**healthcare marketing company**](https://www.inboundmedic.com/blog/the-best-medical-marketing-companies) consists of a team of specialists focused on helping medical practices get the word out while addressing their unique **business needs**. They provide protection with uncompromising industry standards, such as HIPAA, ensuring that every campaign safeguards patient privacy and data security. This commitment is essential for building patient trust and staying compliant within the crowded market of healthcare providers. Healthcare-specific agencies fully immerse themselves in the particular challenges that the healthcare sector faces, tackling issues like patient acquisition and regulatory compliance more effectively than a general marketing firm. They understand the nuances of the healthcare industry, which is crucial for developing targeted marketing plans. For instance, these agencies know how to implement HIPAA-compliant tools for email marketing and predictive targeting. This level of **specialized industry expertise** not only ensures that all [marketing initiatives](https://www.inboundmedic.com/blog/biotech-marketing-agency) are legally sound but also aligns with what patients desire, setting the stage for **improved** [**patient engagement**](https://www.inboundmedic.com/blog/the-best-healthcare-website-design-company) and ethical growth.

### How Marketing Agencies Operate

Healthcare marketing agencies work because they provide scalable services, with the precision and focus that each practice needs. Most agencies work under the model of monthly retainers, or on a project basis. This model provides practices the nimbleness to do what they do best — deploy resources where they’re most effective. For example, a practice may select a full-service package one month to get their website redesigned and optimized for SEO. The next month, it could reduce in size and focus more on [reputation management and analytics](https://www.inboundmedic.com/blog/costs-of-inbound-medical-marketing-services). One major difference is that practices who partner with agencies tend to feel less day-to-day control over marketing actions. This trade-off is offset by the advantage of having a specialized expert team tackle these high-level but efficient tasks. Many agencies have team members working across multiple time zones, providing around-the-clock movement on campaigns even after traditional offices close. This is particularly advantageous for businesses located in thriving metropolitan markets. Cities such as New York and Los Angeles would be in very fierce competition.

### Services Provided by Agencies

The services offered by healthcare marketing agencies are extensive. They’re experts in everything from web design and development to deep analytics and automated, personalized patient engagement. Any reputable healthcare marketing agency will likely tell you that WordPress is the best content management system available for [medical practice website](https://www.inboundmedic.com/blog/zocdoc-alternatives) [s](https://www.inboundmedic.com/blog/healthcare-marketing-agency). Due to its flexibility and adaptability to inbound marketing strategies, WordPress is the platform that easily supports SEO, blogging, and analytics integration. These agencies give you access to advanced healthcare tools such as [HIPAA-compliant predictive targeting](https://www.inboundmedic.com/blog/marketing-for-doctors) and automated patient surveys. These tools help practices identify and interact with those high-value patients at the moment that matters. Agencies know how to create a practice’s brand voice. They make sure that each and every content item, from a blog article to a paid advertisement, really speaks to the target audience.

## Benefits of In-House Medical Marketing

There are distinct benefits to creating an in-house medical marketing team. It tailors the approach to meet the unique needs of doctors, surgeons, and medical practices. Consider your medical practice website your hardest-working marketing and sales staff member. Read our guide and you’ll be on your way to unlocking its full potential. Platforms such as WordPress, named a [Top 100 website](https://www.inboundmedic.com/blog/best-website-design-for-hospitals/) by PC Magazine, are heavily lauded for their versatility. They’re a valuable tool that improves the power of [inbound marketing efforts](https://www.inboundmedic.com/blog/pharma-marketing). Below, we dive into the main advantages of keeping your marketing tactics in-house.

### Greater control over strategies

[**In-house marketing team**](https://www.inboundmedic.com/blog/healthcare-marketing-agency) **s** offer unmatched control over your marketing strategy, allowing you to manage the time, money, and attention spent effectively. Each strategy is tailored to match your [**healthcare business** goals](https://www.inboundmedic.com/blog/best-website-design-for-hospitals) with precision. Thanks to direct oversight, last-minute needs can be swiftly addressed, enabling quick adjustments in your marketing plans. For instance, if you introduce a new service, you can easily update your WordPress website or create a targeted [**social media marketing** campaign](https://www.inboundmedic.com/medical-marketing-services) to promote it. This power of quick execution is particularly useful for a medical practice to pivot in a crowded market, ensuring your services reach healthcare professionals and potential patients efficiently. Your budgeting becomes more manageable and predictable, providing better control over salaries, benefits, and marketing tools. Even social media ad platforms like SocialClimb allow you to refine campaigns based on real-time data. This transparency not only simplifies financial planning but also ensures that each dollar is spent efficiently, enhancing your marketing capabilities. An **internal marketing team** can lead to more measurable results, potentially increasing patient engagement and helping you see five additional patients per day. This growth signifies that you are on your way to enhancing your practice’s patient volume.

### Faster communication and execution

When marketing can be managed in-house, communication is easy. There’s no lag time waiting for third-party agencies to react or pivot to new strategies. An in-house coordinator or specialist can jump on opportunities or challenges as they arise, keeping your practice proactive and agile. For instance, if a patient review goes viral or a competitor launches a promotion, your team can act without delay, protecting and even enhancing your brand reputation. This rapid pace directly translates to execution. Looking to promote a new product line? Your in-house team can turn it around within a matter of hours, not days. This flexibility can be crucial for practices that provide time-sensitive services, like elective surgeries or new patient consultations.

### Deep understanding of brand identity

Your internal marketing team lives and breathes your brand every day, making them better suited to represent your healthcare business authentically. They understand the intricacies of patient behaviors, your place in the competitive healthcare market, and your long-term strategy. This focus allows them to craft original, compelling stories and engaging images tailored to your audience. This method really expresses your personality and values as opposed to being kept to cookie-cutter templates. This familiarity is proven to help your WordPress site — the cornerstone of your inbound marketing strategy — get set up and optimized effectively. Your team can focus on high-quality SEO, engaging blog posts, and accurate analytics, increasing growth by as much as 15%. If you are able to bring on an in-house [**medical marketing specialist**](https://www.inboundmedic.com/medical-marketing-services), it’s an investment you should seriously consider.

## Drawbacks of In-House Medical Marketing

Developing an internal marketing team appears to be the go-to solution for many medical practices. However, this approach can be dangerous in several key ways. Maintaining a highly-skilled, [specialized healthcare marketing company](https://www.inboundmedic.com/blog/best-med-spa-marketing-company/) is difficult and expensive. When considering resource management and the need to stay on top of shifting industry trends, this strategy quickly reveals its shortcomings. Below, we explore the main disadvantages that healthcare professionals should be aware of.

### 1\. Higher upfront investment

Building an in-house marketing team, particularly for [**healthcare marketing companies**](https://www.inboundmedic.com/blog/healthcare-marketing-firms), involves a significant money investment. When hiring specialized roles like a content manager, SEO manager, media buyer, or videographer, you’re making substantial, separate investments. On average, a content manager makes just over $81,000 a year in the United States, while an SEO manager earns about $93,000 per year. Media buyers and videographers also command high salaries, averaging $79,000 and $75,000 respectively. These figures reflect the need for skilled professionals who can develop the specialized industry expertise required for effective [marketing campaigns](https://www.inboundmedic.com/blog/costs-of-inbound-medical-marketing-services). These costs are just the beginning. You must also consider expenses for software licenses, analytics tools, and ongoing professional development to keep pace with the latest marketing processes. Such investments ensure that in-house teams are a long-term commitment, which may not yield immediate returns. For many hospitals and smaller practices, this level of investment can strain budgets, leaving little room for other essential functions to be adequately staffed. Outsourcing marketing to an experienced healthcare marketing agency can be a viable alternative. This approach allows practices to leverage external marketing capabilities without the high overhead costs associated with maintaining a full-time internal marketing team. By collaborating with specialized marketing agencies, healthcare businesses can access a broader range of [marketing resources and tools](https://www.inboundmedic.com/blog/body-sculpting-marketing), ultimately enhancing their [patient acquisition strategies](https://www.inboundmedic.com/blog/patient-acquisition).

### 2\. Limited access to specialized skills

In-house marketing teams often lack the breadth of expertise that specialized healthcare marketing companies can provide. By collaborating with an experienced healthcare marketing agency, you gain access to a larger talent pool and marketing capabilities. These agencies offer specialists in [**targeted patient acquisition** systems](https://www.inboundmedic.com/blog/weight-loss-clinic-marketing), [conversion optimization](https://www.inboundmedic.com/blog/zocdoc-alternatives), healthcare SEO, and more. In contrast, an internal marketing team may struggle to grasp these niches, leading to less effective marketing plans. Even the most skilled in-house marketers may find it challenging to execute complex campaigns without the cutting-edge tools and technologies utilized by external marketing agencies. This gap becomes particularly evident when implementing [high-performing inbound strategies](https://www.inboundmedic.com/blog/how-to-market-a-dental-practice). Such strategies should integrate intuitive website design with effective [digital marketing approaches](https://www.inboundmedic.com/blog/ophthalmology-marketing) to efficiently drive and convert patients, ultimately enhancing patient engagement.

### 3\. Challenges with scalability

Scaling an in-house marketing team to meet growing demands is a time-intensive process. Hiring and training new staff often takes weeks if not months which can postpone urgent [marketing campaigns and initiatives](https://www.inboundmedic.com/blog/hospital-marketing). Agencies are able to quickly shift resources and change direction on a campaign. They quickly adjust to changes in volume or direction, such as launching new services or responding to movements by competitors. In-house teams are constrained by the fact that they too have a full plate. When internal staff are pulled in every direction, marketing easily becomes an afterthought, resulting in sporadic, inconsistent efforts. This inconsistency can drastically limit potential long-term revenue growth and leave practices vulnerable to lost opportunities in an **increasingly competitive landscape**.

## Benefits of Hiring a Healthcare Marketing Agency

Hiring a [healthcare marketing agency like healthcarespending.com](https://www.inboundmedic.com/blog/what-is-lead-generation-in-healthcare/) provides that specialized support, specifically focused on the unique demands of your [medical practice, surgeon, or healthcare organization](https://www.inboundmedic.com/blog/healthcare-marketing-strategy/). Some might prefer to go the in-house route; however, the agency model typically offers a more robust and streamlined solution. From providing measurable returns to bringing in specialized insight into the industry, an agency will make sure that your marketing strategies are scalable and effective.

### 1\. Access to Diverse Expertise

One of the most significant advantages of hiring a healthcare marketing agency is the access to a team of seasoned specialists. Don’t limit your potential impact to a single in-house hire. Access a team of talented professionals, from web designers and copywriters to SEO experts, social media strategists, and account managers, all working collaboratively on your behalf. These specialists team up to design campaigns that are holistic, covering every angle of your marketing efforts. For instance, if you’re redesigning your website, an agency can develop a WordPress-based hub designed specifically for inbound marketing. This configuration supercharges your [content strategy](https://www.inboundmedic.com/blog/orthopedic-web-design) and makes your website your greatest marketing and sales asset. According to a Pew Research study, 59% of U.S. Adults look for health-related content on the internet. With an agency, you can ensure your digital footprint is clean, professional, and easy to navigate. The result is patient engagement in a steady flow and a $2 million boost in revenue from five additional patients a day.

### 2\. Faster Implementation of Campaigns

Agencies work with tried-and-true workflows and methodologies, allowing for speedy execution of effective marketing campaigns. Where in-house teams might hit delays because they lack the necessary resources or skills, agencies provide efficiency. They have the resources and expertise to manage everything from web development to paid ads, ensuring campaigns are rolled out efficiently and effectively, with little to no downtime. For example, an agency can make the process of launching a digital advertising campaign to specific demographics quick and efficient. Weekly meetings and ongoing reporting provide transparency and visibility into the work. Their experience allows them to tweak strategies in real time to ensure the best possible performance. That immediacy increases your visibility in the market and puts you on the path to meeting goals for growth, like boosting patient volume by 15%.

### 3\. Cost-Effectiveness for Short-Term Needs

Surprisingly enough, contrary to popular belief, hiring an agency tends to be less expensive than trying to create an in-house team. Hiring agencies remove costs such as payroll taxes, benefits, PTO, etc. On average, they cost half as much as hiring internally while delivering a 3:1 to 5:1 return on investment. Whether it’s for a short-term project or the need to scale up quickly, agencies offer the flexibility to spread budgets across resources. A healthy recurring monthly fee, $10,000+, allows you to do web design, SEO, content creation, analytics and reporting, and much more. This ensures you get quality execution and avoid the low-cost, low-quality services that hurt your brand.

## Drawbacks of Hiring a Healthcare Marketing Agency

Despite the benefits healthcare marketing companies can offer, there are significant drawbacks to be aware of, particularly when outsourcing marketing. These drawbacks can hinder the precision, speed, and control necessary for achieving your medical practice’s objectives. Let’s take a closer look at how relying on external marketing agencies may impact your healthcare business.

### 1\. Limited familiarity with your brand

Most agencies will begin by doing a high-level audit, competitive research, and an overall strategy. Though these steps are necessary, they can lead to significant delays in implementation. The crux of this problem is the agency’s lack of knowledge about your brand. Their team is juggling a ton of different clients at once. In the process, they can lose sight of your practice’s specific mission, values, and patient needs. For example, if your medical practice specializes in advanced cosmetic surgery, your target audience and tone of communication will differ from a general family practice. Agencies may need time to understand these nuances, which can hurt the effectiveness of initial campaigns. An outsider can’t learn your brand voice and [patient expectations](https://www.inboundmedic.com/blog/digital-marketing-for-healthcare) in the span of a few days. It requires time to create a content strategy that goes hand-in-hand with them.

### 2\. Potential communication delays

When you’re working with an agency, communication channels are usually much more regimented. So while this helps contribute a layer of professionalism and polish, it can be a real drag on the process. Agencies often schedule their client work a month out. If you’re looking to pivot overnight, or address an unforeseen need, the answer can come slower. Know that unforeseen work will incur additional charges. If you’re marketing a new [laser dermatology service](https://www.inboundmedic.com/blog/category/dermatology-marketing/), you want to get the word out quickly on your website and social media pages. Agency timelines can be a challenge if you have urgent demands. This lack of flexibility is a major downside. It creates burden shifting for practices that rely on quick turnaround on marketing efforts to bring in [new patients](https://www.inboundmedic.com/blog/?blog-posts%5B%5D=plastic-surgery-marketing).

### 3\. Dependency on external parties

When you hire an agency, you’re putting a large part of your marketing strategy into their hands. Despite the fact that most agencies are competent and capable professionals, this reliance creates a recipe for disaster. For example, some healthcare agencies don’t have a very clear approval process. Without direct access to the team handling your account, you risk losing control over the finer details of your campaigns. Agencies typically operate on retainer agreements, beginning as little as 8 hours per week. As appealing as this option sounds, it won’t give you the commitment your practice needs. Some agencies are more concerned about their bottom line. This can lead to biased recommendations that serve their own interests rather than your practice’s sustainable growth.

## Key Factors to Consider When Choosing

Choosing between a healthcare marketing agency and an in-house medical marketing team is a choice that deserves serious consideration. Each choice brings different benefits and opportunities. Figuring out which one is best will depend on your practice’s goals, resources, and expectations. Continue reading below, as we unpack the key factors to consider, providing a thorough breakdown to help you navigate this decision-making process.

### Budget and Resource Availability

Price tends to be the first thing taken into consideration when debating between an agency and an in-house team. Agencies have the flexibility to provide unique pricing models. You can decide to fund individual campaigns or hire them on a monthly basis. Most agencies will begin by committing a minimum of 8 hours a week to your account. They will be able to grow their efforts to fit your individual needs as your needs increase. This kind of flexibility is especially helpful to practices that have high variability in patient demand or seasonal trends. An in-house team offers predictable costs. Since salaries, benefits, and other expenses are the same each month, it can help you better formulate your budget to accommodate that. Establishing a capable in-house team requires a huge initial outlay. You have to factor in hiring experienced professionals, investing in marketing technology, and offering continuous education. If you want quality web design, development, SEO and paid advertising, you’re going to need a healthy [inbound marketing budget](https://www.inboundmedic.com/blog/marketing-for-plastic-surgeons). Whether you go in-house or agency side, aim for a minimum of $10k per month.

### Long-Term vs Short-Term Goals

Your practice’s goals are going to be the biggest factor in your decision. For growth and scalability over the long haul, agencies have the experience and track record of established systems. We’ve assisted our healthcare marketing agency clients’ practices increase their patient intake by 15% or more through strategic, targeted campaigns. They provide the ability to make real-time changes driven by analytics, so your marketing is always on point even as trends shift. An in-house team has the agility to quickly launch campaigns similarly to promote a new service or location. This agility cuts out the usual onboarding time that’s required when working through an agency. Counting on a single marketing practitioner can leave holes in your strategy and execution. Not one person can really stay on top of every area of medical marketing, either.

### Internal Team’s Existing Capabilities

Consider the technical proficiency of your staff. Tools like SocialClimb keep in-house teams connected, allowing them to collaborate on campaigns designed to keep them competitive. This success depends on a robust understanding of marketing principles. Agencies, with their fast, specialized teams, often come loaded with experience in everything from web design to content marketing. They are fantastic at developing WordPress-based websites that are tailored towards inbound strategies. This is especially important as your website is the hub of all your sales efforts.

### Desired Level of Control and Flexibility

Control is the next key factor. Even with a full in-house team, you’re in charge of every aspect of your marketing strategies, making sure they all reinforce your practice’s overall vision. This could translate to a slower overall adaptation to new trends if your in-house team is lacking the skills or resources to help. While taking more day-to-day control, agencies, direct recipients of federal funding, have outside perspectives and innovative ideas. Hire the right agency — one that knows your brand’s ins and outs. They’ll be focused on collaboration as they work to build tailored solutions, rather than one-size-fits-all solutions. That mix of flexibility and specialized know-how is often invaluable for practices looking to differentiate themselves in increasingly [competitive market](https://www.inboundmedic.com/blog/plastic-surgery-advertising-strategies-ethics-and-costs/) s.

## How to Decide the Right Fit for You

Creating a winning marketing plan takes careful consideration. Whatever alternative you decide to pursue should best fit your practice’s goals, available resources, and long-term vision. This decision comes from a fundamental understanding—your website is not just a digital brochure. It’s a lasting testament to all of your hard-fought marketing and sales efforts! A properly designed WordPress site, backed by a solid inbound strategy, will accelerate your growth like nothing else. Here are the most important ones to help you determine which is right for you.

### Evaluate your current marketing challenges

The first step is figuring out what challenges your practice has. Do you feel like you’re losing [patient acquisition battles](https://www.inboundmedic.com/blog/digital-marketing-for-medical-practices) even after ramping up your practice’s marketing initiatives? Is your old website not doing the job of turning visitors into new patients? These questions should help you determine if your needs are better served by a deep bench of a specialized agency or the breadth of an in-house team. If you’re not showing up on search engines, now’s the time to act. An agency experienced in SEO and content creation, like us here at TBC, might be just the ticket for you. Look at the agency’s history. Request case studies, client testimonials, and [measurable outcomes from their past campaigns](https://www.inboundmedic.com/blog/digital-marketing-for-medical-practices). An agency with a proven track record in [healthcare marketing understands the complexities of industry regulations](https://www.inboundmedic.com/blog/marketing-for-healthcare-focused-private-equity-firms/). This deep expertise enables them to bring you solutions uniquely suited to your practice. Metrics like a 7-10x ROI in 90 days can be a strong signal of their capability to drive measurable results.

### Assess your team’s capacity and skills

Think about the skills and capacity of your existing staff. Creating an in-house marketing department means hiring the right people to develop web design, SEO, social media, content creation, and analytics. This can be a lengthy and expensive process. A great agency is proud to call the best technical minds and best marketers their team. They don’t need much training, so they can hit the ground running and deliver results immediately. For instance, if your existing staff lacks experience in [advanced digital marketing trends](https://www.inboundmedic.com/blog/regenerative-medicine-marketing), such as managing [paid ad campaigns or optimizing conversion rates](https://www.inboundmedic.com/blog/mommy-makeover-marketing-for-plastic-surgeons), partnering with an agency may be more efficient. Agencies need to ensure there’s ongoing education on new technologies, strategies, and ways of thinking. It helps your practice stay one step ahead in an increasingly competitive market.

### Weigh the importance of speed versus customization

Determine if speed or customization is more important for your objectives. Agencies are able to produce speedy results because of their well-trodden paths and resources. An A+ agency will always put a strong emphasis on customization. They’ll take the time to get to know your brand and keep you involved in the process through regular meetings and updates. Client-focused in-house teams deliver a more personalized, hands-on approach. They typically require much more lead time to realize comparable outcomes. Balancing these factors will depend on the urgency of your marketing needs and your commitment to long-term growth.

## Conclusion

Ultimately, the decision between an in-house team versus a healthcare marketing agency comes down to your medical practice’s individual needs, goals, and available resources. Each has its own sets of advantages. An in-house team gives you direct control and a deep familiarity with your practice. First and foremost, a marketing agency brings a level of [specialized expertise, all-encompassing industry insights, and scalable solutions](https://www.inboundmedic.com/blog/cosmetic-surgery-marketing-agency). Consider the costs, time, and expertise it will take. Consider how you’re planning for growth in the long term, and your need for flexibility. The right choice helps you realize your vision, while making patient acquisition easy and efficient. If you’re looking for further direction or are ready to dive in and implement these strategies, contact a healthcare marketing agency you can trust. Only experienced professionals can provide you the kind of insights that are specific to your practice. The choice you make today will lay the foundation for your practice’s future and set you on the path to sustainable, long-term growth.
