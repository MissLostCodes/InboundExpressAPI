## Frequently Asked Questions

### — Why schedule a strategy session?

This is not a sales call. It’s a high-level conversation designed to explore one key question:

Is your current digital infrastructure capable of acquiring patients in the new era of AI-driven search?

If you’re doing $100K+ /month and operating in a high-trust specialty, we’ll use this session to:

- Audit your web foundation
- Identify gaps in your current patient acquisition stack
- Share a custom blueprint for building your AI-Native Patient Generation Engine

This is for practice owners and physician-entrepreneurs ready to rethink their growth strategy at the infrastructure level — not campaign level.

### — What exactly is this session?

It’s a live 60-minute private consultation over Google Meet. We’ll walk through:

- Your current visibility in AI systems

- Technical gaps in your web foundation

- Opportunities to show up as the **cited expert** in your category

- A clear roadmap to rebuild your site into an always-on, LLM-optimized patient engine


You’ll leave with a **high-trust Patient Growth Blueprint** based on your revenue model, procedures, and target patients.

### — Is this a sales call?

No. This is a strategic discovery session to explore whether our system is aligned with your practice, your goals, your vision and your current infrastructure.

If there’s a fit, we’ll talk about what collaboration could look like.

If not, we’ll still leave you with clarity, a diagnostic of your current visibility, and a new lens on how AI is reshaping private-pay acquisition.

### — Who is this session for?

We only offer these sessions to qualified medical practices. You should meet the following:

- You are the **owner or key decision-maker** at your medical practice

- You operate in a **high-value niche** (plastic surgery, orthopedic surgery, concierge medicine, regenerative, stem cell, etc.)

- Your average revenue per patient is **$10,000 or more**

- Your practice generates **$100K+/month in top-line revenue**

- You are not a startup. You have proof of service-market fit and a track record of success

- You’re looking to **own your acquisition system**, not rent visibility through agencies or ad spend

- You have the capacity to invest in infrastructure that pays off for years — not months


### — Is there a cost?

The session is complimentary — **but not casual**.

We only confirm strategy calls with practices that meet the above criteria and are actively looking to evolve their patient acquisition in the age of AI and LLMs.

If you’re looking for quick fixes or outsourced marketing help, this isn’t for you.

### — What’s the outcome of this session?

You’ll walk away with:

- A diagnostic of how LLMs like ChatGPT and Gemini currently _see_ your practice

- A breakdown of your current digital patient funnel

- A tailored blueprint for building a self-sustaining, AI-powered inbound system that converts trust into revenue


You’ll also understand what’s blocking your visibility — and whether we’re the right architecture partner to help you scale.
