Cost depends heavily on features, complexity of the use case, and timelines. Average costs of comparable development can be anywhere from $50,000 to more than $500,000. Working with experts allows you to forecast your unique requirements.

### How do I choose a custom healthcare software development partner?

Ask for experience specific to the healthcare industry, proven success stories, and knowledge of [compliance standards](https://www.inboundmedic.com/blog/pharma-marketing) such as HIPAA. By reading reviews and checking out their portfolio, you can be sure to find a trustworthy partner.
